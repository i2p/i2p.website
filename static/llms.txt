# I2P - The Invisible Internet Project

> I2P is a fully encrypted private network layer designed for anonymous communication. It provides strong anonymity through garlic routing, unidirectional tunnels, and a distributed network database. I2P has been in active development since 2003 and supports applications including anonymous websites (eepsites), secure messaging, file sharing, and more.

I2P differs from Tor by focusing on internal services rather than outproxy access to the clearnet. All traffic stays within the I2P network by default. The network uses garlic routing (bundling multiple encrypted messages together) and unidirectional tunnels (separate inbound and outbound paths) to provide stronger anonymity guarantees than onion routing alone.

The reference implementation is written in Java, with alternative implementations in C++ (i2pd) and other languages. I2P runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.
