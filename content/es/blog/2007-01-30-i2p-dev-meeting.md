<div class="irc-log"> 15:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi&lt;p&gt; 15:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 1) Net status&lt;p&gt; 15:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 2) Syndie status&lt;p&gt; 15:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; )))&lt;p&gt; 15:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 3) I2PSnark status&lt;p&gt; 15:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 4) ???&lt;p&gt; 15:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi&lt;p&gt; 15:07  * jrandom waves&lt;p&gt; 15:07 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;mk&gt; I just made the post, so feel free to respond&lt;p&gt; 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-January/001331.html&lt;p&gt; 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; w3wt, shall do mk, thanks&lt;p&gt; 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; (now lets get into our archived weekly development meeting :)&lt;p&gt; 15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; short set of status notes this week, but lets jump through 'em&lt;p&gt; 15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; 1) Net status&lt;p&gt; 15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; no real changes here, though we've had a substantial decline in build success rates as charted on stats.i2p&lt;p&gt; 15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; though not the catastrophic failures we saw last summer&lt;p&gt; 15:09 &lt;+zzz&gt; yes, contrary to your rather sunny assessment in the notes, we hit a 3-month low in tunnel build success late last week. There has been only a modest recovery in last few days&lt;p&gt; 15:09 &lt;Complication2&gt; On the net status side, I've seen some increased routing pressure, which has caused about 10% of bandwidth increase, but not much more&lt;p&gt; 15:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye, thats the odd part zzz - the failure rate has substantially incrased, but irc hasn't been substantially affected&lt;p&gt; 15:11 &lt;Complication2&gt; It "feels" like a bit of significant routing capacity either recently left the network, or experienced downtime&lt;p&gt; 15:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; Complication2: hmm, there were a few nodes with hardware and network trouble, which would correlate with that&lt;p&gt; 15:12 &lt;+zzz&gt; from over $here irc was quite affected&lt;p&gt; 15:12 &lt;Complication2&gt; but I found that my stat recorder has been recording 0B files since October... so I honestly don't know&lt;p&gt; 15:12 &lt;Complication2&gt; had a typo in my script :O&lt;p&gt; 15:12 &lt;jrandom&gt; d'oh&lt;p&gt; 15:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; zzz: hopefully that has passed though, right?&lt;p&gt; 15:13 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'd say things are improving although during evenings GMT things are worse than in mornings&lt;p&gt; 15:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm interesting&lt;p&gt; 15:15 &lt;Complication2&gt; if most users are still from Europe, during evenings GMT, their count could be rising...&lt;p&gt; 15:15 &lt;+zzz&gt; just remember weather is always sunny inside a colo :)&lt;p&gt; 15:16 &lt;Complication2&gt; (but I haven't checked theland.i2p lately)&lt;p&gt; 15:16 &lt;jrandom&gt; hehe&lt;p&gt; 15:16 &lt;jrandom&gt; (we have had an increase in the last few days, with known: hitting 555 earlier this afternoon, and now sitting at 570)&lt;p&gt; 15:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; ((active: 266/367))&lt;p&gt; 15:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; at least, according to my router&lt;p&gt; 15:18 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 1) Net status?&lt;p&gt; 15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, lets hop on over to 2) Syndie status&lt;p&gt; 15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; some hefty stuff going on here, with a new release coming in the next day or two&lt;p&gt; 15:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; i'm doing my best to clear as many of the bugs filed as possible, and there are two major functional improvements in the upcoming release - better handling for banning, and support for a whole slew of privacy, authentication, and authorization policies for various forums&lt;p&gt; 15:23 &lt;jrandom&gt; when the new release is out though, there'll be more to discuss on that front (though most of that discussion is going on within syndie, naturaly :)&lt;p&gt; 15:23 &lt;jrandom&gt; as for the contest - there's still one more day left to file your bugs!  the winners and supporters will be announced in next week's meeting&lt;p&gt; 15:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have any questions/comments/concerns re: syndie status?&lt;p&gt; 15:25 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, lets jump on to 3) I2PSnark status&lt;p&gt; 15:25 &lt;jrandom&gt; zzz, wanna give us an update on things?&lt;p&gt; 15:25 &lt;+zzz&gt; yes&lt;p&gt; 15:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; at the mtg 2 wks ago I was at a good stopping point, but then I found and fixed some real memory-eaters and made some other tweaks...&lt;p&gt; 15:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'm now at a good stopping point again so folks please test CVS and report results here or in syndie - thanks&lt;p&gt; 15:27 &lt;+zzz&gt; on the startup thrashing...&lt;p&gt; 15:27 &lt;+zzz&gt; there were some good suggestions in syndie...&lt;p&gt; 15:28 &lt;+zzz&gt; my first idea didn't really work, but I cleaned up a lock so that the web page doesn't hang at startup anymore, so it _looks_ faster&lt;p&gt; 15:28 &lt;+zzz&gt; may stab at the other suggestions later. &lt;eot&gt;&lt;p&gt; 15:29 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh cool, thanks zzz!&lt;p&gt; 15:30 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump to our good ol' catch-all: 4) ???&lt;p&gt; 15:30 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else tobring up for the meeting?&lt;p&gt; 15:33 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, if not...&lt;p&gt; 15:33  * jrandom winds up&lt;p&gt; 15:34  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed&lt;p&gt; </div>
