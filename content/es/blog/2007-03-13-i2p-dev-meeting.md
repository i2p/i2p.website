16:02 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi 16:02  * jrandom waves 16:02 &lt;jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-March/001338.html 16:02 &lt;jrandom&gt; y'all've had a few hours to read those (and of course to read the related syndie posts ;) so lets just jump in to 1) net status and 0.6.1.28 16:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; there's been a bunch going on in this front lately - zzz wanna gives us a rundown of whats coming in 0.6.1.28? 16:05 &lt;+zzz&gt; ok 16:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; lots of improvements in tunnel building and upstream performance, mainly benefitting those who have a lot of outbound traffic or are upstream-bandwidth-constrained... 16:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; like i2psnark users... 16:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'm getting good results in testing so looking forward to getting it out there to all... 16:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; [w3wt] 16:07 &lt;+zzz&gt; I have one tweak to make a parameter configurable, as requested by Amiga4000, should get that in soon. 16:08 &lt;+zzz&gt; And thx for the $$ offer, however please keep it in the bank. 16:08 &lt;+zzz&gt; EOT :) 16:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; r0x0r - added to halloffame.html :) 16:09 &lt;+zzz&gt; haha I'm famous now 16:10 &lt;jrandom&gt; the changes look pretty promising, and they do seem that they'll have their largest impact once its widely deployed 16:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; just bounce me a msg when you want me to pull the trigger and i'll get it packaged and pushed w/in a day or so 16:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything they'd like to bring up re: net status? 16:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, lets hop on over to 2) syndie dev status 16:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; lots going on here (as you can see if you're using syndie or following https://trac.i2p.net/timeline ) 16:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; i expect we'll have a new 1.005a release in the next day or two (obviously not including the things we're discussing in (3) below) 16:15 &lt;TrevorReznik&gt; jrandom: do you have time for a short query? 16:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; if its for the meeting, certainly (if its on 2), now is good, if it doesnt fit the agenda, we've got 5) ??? for everything else :) 16:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; (if its not something for the meeting, hit me as a priv msg) 16:17 &lt;TrevorReznik&gt; ok ;) ill wait 16:18 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything for 2) syndie dev status? 16:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, lets switch to 3) Syndie GUI directions 16:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; as mentioned in the mail, lots going on in this direction - mk has put together some really interesting ideas and we'll likely see it in syndie sooner rather than later 16:20 &lt;+zzz&gt; call me a traditionalist, but I think the current multipane thunderbird-like i/f is pretty good 16:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm, with the multipane view, would that fit more with mk's mods than our current multitab interface though? 16:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; do you use the preview tab on the thread view now, for instance? 16:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; right now there's no choice but to go to the preview tab to see attachments, which I don't like - would rather just see the whole thing in the lower pane 16:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; sorry not conversant in the details of mk's mods so can't answer your other question 16:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; ah, so it would work better w/ mk's view (once we get it using the MessageView instead of MessagePreview down there) 16:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; oh, there's a screencap of mk's proposal up at http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/mk_max.png 16:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; mk: perhaps we could find a way to make the tree above vs. left configurable? 16:29 &lt;+zzz&gt; thunderbird used to give you a choice of 2 or 3 layouts for the 3 panes, but can't find it in the options atm 16:30 &lt;jrandom&gt; i remember reviewing their diagram for that, yeah 16:31 &lt;jrandom&gt; perhaps if we can find a way to get mk's "explorer" parentable cleanly in an arbitrary SWT Composite we could use it both via the current tabbed GUI as a tab and in the fullscreen mode as a screen 16:33 &lt;+zzz&gt; I like the tabs for the less-common stuff like options, syndication configuration, etc; I think that tabs combined with the multipane for the common stuff is good. imho anyway. 16:34 &lt;jrandom&gt; do you run syndie fullscreen or only in part of the screen 16:35 &lt;+zzz&gt; usually full 16:35 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm cool 16:36 &lt;+zzz&gt; but because I'm using a 1024x768 laptop these days... on my 1600x1200 desktop I wouldn't take up the whole screen 16:37 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, for all y-all watching in the background, please post up your thoughts and ideas whenever its convient for you 16:37 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh aye, makes sense 16:38  * jrandom is on an 800x600 net cafe box atm 16:38 &lt;@detonate&gt; hmm, i'm having trouble getting i2p working again 16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; it's doing something, using lots of cpu, but the web console doesn't seem to ever start 16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; i guess i could try running it in windows 16:39 &lt;jrandom&gt; anything in the logs? 16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; not really, it just says that i need to reseed 16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; are the logs quieter than before? 16:39 &lt;+zzz&gt; wrapper.log NPE's? 16:41 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, if there isn't anything else for 3, lets jump on to 4) Feb bug harvesting contest results 16:42 &lt;jrandom&gt; congrats & thanks to void, Darn, and Anonymous!   16:42 &lt;jrandom&gt; (and to everyone else who has helped out, of course) 16:42 &lt;jrandom&gt; bug reports help us track down these issues and make sure they get taken care of, so please keep 'em coming 16:43 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, if there isn't anything on 4), lets jump to 5) ??? 16:43 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything they want to bring up for the meeting? 16:45 &lt;bar&gt; there was someone asking in the forums why the graphs displaying bw seem a bit off 16:45 &lt;bar&gt; thought you might have an idea or two 16:46 &lt;bar&gt; (basically, they peak at 1.5 x max bw setting) 16:47 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye, wasn't sure *which* bw graphs they were referring to (each of the graphs accurrately render the stat which they represent, from what i've seen) 16:47 &lt;@detonate&gt; nm, it's working again :) 16:48 &lt;+zzz&gt; it's the first 3 graphs on graphs.jsp, which seem much higher than the bw displayed on the left side of the router console, and for me are much higher than my configured upstream limit 16:49  * jrandom loads 16:51 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm, and that includes the upstream avg w/ burst in mind? 16:52 &lt;+zzz&gt; yes 16:52 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm, ill look into it 16:53 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'll investigate further, guess it doesn't ring a bell for you 16:53 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting? 16:57 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not... 16:57  * jrandom winds up 16:58  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed </div>
