Hi y'all, there's a new I2P release available for your enjoyment at http://www.i2p.net/download

This release includes some experimental tunnel throughput enhancements, eepget fixes, network backlog handling, i2psnark fixes, among other changes. As always, a full list of changes can be found at http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/history.txt?rev=HEAD

This release is backwards compatible, and upgrading shouldn't be a problem.

Thanks go to zzz and Complication for their work making all these changes happen!
