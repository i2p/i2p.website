# I2P Enhancement Proposals

This section contains all I2P Enhancement Proposals (IEPs) - formal documents that describe changes, improvements, and enhancements to the I2P network and specifications.

## About the Proposal Process

I2P proposals follow a structured process adapted from the Tor proposal process. Each proposal goes through several stages:

- **Open**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Ready to implement
- **Finished**: Accepted and implemented
- **Closed**: Merged into main specifications
- **Rejected**: Not being implemented
