The I2P network thrives because of our community. Whether you're a developer, translator, researcher, or enthusiast, there are many ways to contribute to the project.

## 🚀 For Developers

### Core Development
I2P is open source and we welcome contributions to the codebase. Whether you want to fix bugs, add features, or improve performance, your code contributions make a difference.

- **Get started**: Check out our [new developer guide](/docs/developers/new-developers)
- **Source code**: [GitLab](https://i2pgit.org) (also available inside I2P at http://git.idk.i2p)
- **Monthly meetings**: Join us on the first Tuesday of each month
- **IRC channels**: #i2p-dev on IRC2P for development discussions

### Application Development
Build applications that run on I2P!

- **API documentation**: Learn about [SAM, BOB, and I2PTunnel APIs](/docs/api)
- **Streaming library**: Use the I2P streaming library for your apps
- **New routers**: Consider building an I2P router in [Rust, Go, or other languages](/en/blog/2025/10/16/new-i2p-routers/)

### Host Infrastructure

Help new users join the network by running infrastructure services:

- **Reseed servers**: Help new routers bootstrap and join the network - see our [reseed documentation](/docs/guides/reseed-server/)
- **Mirror sites**: Host download mirrors to improve availability
- **Services**: Run I2P services like forums, IRC servers, or other community tools

## 📝 Documentation & Translation

### Improve Documentation
Clear documentation helps everyone understand and use I2P better.

- **Writing Guidelines**: Follow our [documentation writing guidelines](/docs/writing-guidelines)
- **Documentation Hub**: Browse and contribute to the [docs section](/docs/)
- **Content Suggestions**: Have ideas? [Contact us](/en/contact/)

### Translation
Make I2P accessible to more people by translating:

- **Website content**: Translate pages into your language
- **Software interface**: Help localize the I2P router interface
- **Documentation**: Translate guides and technical docs
- **New translator's guide**: [Coming soon]

## 🔬 Research & Security

### Security Research
Help make I2P more secure:

- **Code review**: Analyze the codebase for vulnerabilities
- **Threat modeling**: Research potential attacks and defenses
- **Anonymity analysis**: Study the network's privacy properties
- **Responsible disclosure**: Report security issues privately
