## Community-Driven Development

I2P is built by the community, for the community. Your feedback and feature requests help guide our development priorities and shape the future of the project.

### How It Works

1. **Submit Ideas** - Share your feature requests and improvement suggestions
2. **Vote & Discuss** - Upvote features you'd like to see and discuss implementation
3. **Track Progress** - See which features are planned, in progress, or completed  

<br>

**Note:** Feature requests are reviewed regularly by the I2P development team. While we can't implement every suggestion, we carefully consider all feedback in our planning process.
