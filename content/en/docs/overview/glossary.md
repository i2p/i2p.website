This glossary defines common terms used throughout I2P documentation and discussions.

## B

**Blockchain**
A distributed ledger that can record transactions between multiple parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

## D

**Decentralization**
Network architecture that avoids reliance on a single party. Encompasses peer-to-peer, blockchain, federated, and distributed technologies.

**Destination**
The cryptographic identity of a tunnel. These are the identities of clients and servers within the I2P network.

**DHT (Distributed Hash Table)**
Used in some projects to connect peers to each other by storing information in the form of key-value pairs in a distributed manner.

**Distributed Systems**
Academic topic within Computer Science concerned with the design of computer systems that consist of many individual computers connected over a network.

## F

**Federated**
Federation allows separate deployments of a service to communicate with each other through a common protocol.

## H

**Hash**
A number, usually displayed as a string of letters and numbers. It can serve as a "fingerprint" uniquely identifying data.

## I

**I2P**
Invisible Internet Project: a project meant to provide an anonymity layer, so users can communicate anonymously using a range of applications.

**IP Address**
A number of a computer or network which is unique and thus can be used to address it.

## L

**LeaseSet**
A collection of information required to communicate with a client or server at a particular Destination.

## P

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**
Peers make a portion of their resources directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.

## R

**Router**
The core I2P software, which routes encrypted packets on the I2P network.

**RouterIdentity**
A collection of information required to communicate directly with a router.

## T

**TCP/UDP**
The two foundational transport protocols used on the Internet.

**Tunnel**
An anonymous communication pathway between a client or server and the I2P network.

## U

**UX**
User experience, the overall experience of a person using a product or service.

## W

**WebRTC**
A protocol standard for establishing connections in a web browser where data passes directly between users.
