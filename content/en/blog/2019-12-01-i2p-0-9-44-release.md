## Update details

0.9.44 contains an important fix for a denial of service issue in hidden services handling of new encryption types. All users should update as soon as possible.

The release includes initial support for new end-to-end encryption (proposal 144). Work continues on this project, and it is not yet ready for use. There are changes to the console home page, and new embedded HTML5 media players in i2psnark. Additional fixes for firewalled IPv6 networks are included. Tunnel build fixes should result in faster startup for some users.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
