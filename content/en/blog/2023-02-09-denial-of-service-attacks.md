The I2P network is currently being affected by a Denial of Service attack.
The floodfill function of the network has been affected, resulting in responses being disrupted and tunnel build success rates dropping.
Participants in the network have experienced difficulties connecting to I2P sites and using I2P services.
Mitigation strategies are being investigated and implemented gradually.

While the attack has degraded performance, the network remains intact and usable.
Java I2P routers appear to be handling the issues better than i2pd routers for now.
Various mitigations should begin to appear in dev builds of both Java and C++ routers in the next week.
