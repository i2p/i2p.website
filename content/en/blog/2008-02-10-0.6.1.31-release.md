Hi, there's a new I2P release available for your enjoyment at
http://www.i2p2.de/downloads/.

The 0.6.1.31 release will make the I2P release process
independent of jrandom and *.i2p.net servers.
Our new primary mirror is www.i2p2.de, accessible
in I2P at www.i2p2.i2p.

Automatic updates will hosted on several eepsites(I2P Sites),
signed by Complication, for which purpose 0.6.1.31
includes two new release verification keys.

Also included are multiple bugfixes and improvements
to the automatic update mechanism, address book,
I2PSnark and IRC proxy. Support will appear for the
SAM protocol version 2.

This release is backwards compatible.
To update to this release automatically, follow the instructions
on your router console.
If you do not have instructions on your router console, you
must first make the configuration changes documented at
http://forum.i2p/viewtopic.php?t=2532 .

Thanks go to Amiga4000, Complication, echelon, welterde, and many others
for contributing servers, services, test time, and code.

zzz
