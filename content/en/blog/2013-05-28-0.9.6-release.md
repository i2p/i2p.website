0.9.6 includes bug fixes and an update from Jetty 6.1.26 (2010-11-10) to Jetty 7.6.10 (2013-03-12). See below for important information on the Jetty update. The Jetty 7 series is actively maintained and we plan to stay current with it in future I2P releases.

Most users will update via HTTP. Those running development builds will attempt to update via the experimental in-network bittorrent with i2psnark. We've fixed some bugs that will enable more users to update via torrent in the 0.9.7 update cycle.

Files are available on the [download page](/en/downloads/).

## Important fix for Windows Eepsites, first install 0.9.5 only

If you first installed I2P with version 0.9.5, on Windows only, we recommend that you follow the following instructions to fix your eepsite location **before** you update to 0.9.6. Only original installations of 0.9.5-0 on Windows are affected by this issue. If your router version is 0.9.5-0-win1, you already have the fix and need not take any action.

See [this page](https://geti2p.net/misc/ticket919) for instructions.

## Jetty 7 Migration Details

**For most people, the update should just work. If you have multiple Jetty eepsites, OR have made changes to jetty.xml or other Jetty configuration files, including changing the port from 7658, you MUST take manual action AFTER updating.**

- After update, the router will migrate your jetty.xml files to the new Jetty 7 format.
- The migration resets the port to 7658. If you have more than one Jetty eepsite, OR your eepsite is NOT on port 7658, OR you have made other modifications to jetty.xml (for example changing the listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0), you MUST edit the jetty.xml file for each eepsite to fix them up after updating, and restart again.

**The following files will be backed up with a ".jetty6" suffix and then migrated.** If you have made local changes, you may have to edit them manually and restart. See http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty for assistance in configuring Jetty 7.

- ~/.i2p/clients.config
- ~/.i2p/eepsite/jetty.xml
- ~/.i2p/eepsite/jetty-rewrite.xml
- ~/.i2p/eepsite/jetty-ssl.xml
- ~/.i2p/eepsite/contexts/base-context.xml
- ~/.i2p/eepsite/contexts/cgi-context.xml
- ~/.i2p/eepsite/etc/webdefault.xml

## Plugins

Most plugins should work fine with Jetty 7.

- The I2PControl and zzzot plugins must be updated. Your router should download and install the new versions shortly after starting 0.9.6.
- If a plugin does not work, please contact the maintainer for that plugin.
