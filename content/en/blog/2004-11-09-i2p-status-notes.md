Hey everyone, weekly update time

## Index:
1. 0.4.1.4
2. Streaming lib
3. BT progress
4. addressbook.py
5. ???

## 1) 0.4.1.4

The other day we pushed out a new patch update, and 2/3rds of the network has upgraded so far - thanks! Reports have been positive, including lower CPU usage and less failures, along side lower memory usage. The network as a whole has grown a bit, staying consistently in the upper 70s/low 80s as well, which is a good healthy number for the time being.

## 2) Streaming lib

Lets see if I can say the same thing three weeks in a row... Lots of progress, more details when they're available :)

## 3) BT progress

The BitTorrent port has been making leaps and bounds as of late - the other day I installed it and was able to do a swarming transfer between multiple peers entirely through I2P! Perhaps duck can give us an update during the meeting?

## 4) addressbook.py

Ragnarok has put together a python app which lets you subscribe to other people's hosts files, importing and merging new entries with your own. This gives us a base implementation of an addressbook based naming system with locally unique, human readable, and secure names! Perhaps we can get Ragnarok to fill us in on further details in the meeting?

## 5) ???

Thazzit... sorry for the delay, woke up 5 minutes ago :) see y'all shortly
