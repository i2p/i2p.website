categories: ["release"]

The 0.8.3 release contains several performance improvements, including reduction of threads and memory usage, and faster I2CP (client-router) communication.

There is also new SSL router console support, a new reseed configuration page including HTTP proxy support for those behind restrictive firewalls, a new I2CP configuration section including I2CP-over-SSL support for remote clients, a new server connection limits and blacklist configuration section for enhanced DoS protection, and a new HTTP proxy jump server configuration section so you may easily add alternative jump servers. Statistics are now limited by default to reduce memory usage; the full set of statistics may be re-enabled on the stats configuration page. There are also bug fixes, of course, so as usual, upgrading is recommended.
