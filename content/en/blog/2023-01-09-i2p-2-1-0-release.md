## Update details

We have learned several things since our 2.0.0 release in November.
As routers have updated to that release, the network has gone from about 1% to over 60% support for our new SSU2 transport protocol.
First, we have confirmed that SSU2 is a solid, well designed, and secure protocol.
Second, however, we have found and fixed numerous minor or rarely-triggered bugs in the implementation of the protocol.
Cumulatively, the effects of these bugs have reduced the performance of the network.

Also, we are aware of increased tunnel count and reduced tunnel build success rate in the network,
possibly triggered by Bitcoin's new I2P transient address feature,
but made worse by our SSU2 bugs and other congestion control problems.
We are working with Bitcoin and other non-Bitcoin projects to reduce I2P network demands.
We have improved our algorithms to reduce network load during times of congestion.
We are also collaborating with i2pd to develop common congestion control strategies.

Therefore, we have accelerated this release by about six weeks, to get the fixes out to everybody.
i2pd released their version 2.45.0 last week and the early results are encouraging.
New protocols, and distributed networks, are difficult to develop.
Congestion can arrive with little warning and with little clue of the cause.
Thank you for your patience as we have diagnosed and hopefully fixed the problems.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
