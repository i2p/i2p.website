The 0.7.13 release contains several changes and bug fixes to improve performance. It also includes improvements for the plugin support that was introduced in the last release. The new, smaller tunnel build message is enabled, to reduce overhead and increase build success.

Of course, there is the usual assortment of bug fixes as well. Upgrading is recommended.
