I2P release 0.6.1.32
=====================

The 0.6.1.32 release contains several bugfixes,
a new tunnel build algorithm from zzz which regulates
the intensity of tunnel building according to previous levels
of tunnel build success, and other performance improvements.

This release is backward compatible, and if you already have
0.6.1.31 installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file (so you can update automatically).

However, to ensure better distribution of load
between our 3 signed update servers, I recommend that you
perform the following optional check:

* Open the update configuration page on:
http://localhost:7657/configupdate.jsp

* If you see 3 update URLs, no action is needed.
If you see one update URL, open the advanced configuration
page on http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp
and delete the configuration entry beginning with
"router.updateURL=". Then click "Apply", and default
configuration should take effect for update URLs.

* Please note that since 0.6.1.31, configuration entries
may span multiple lines, so please double-check
where the next entry begins, to avoid damaging it!

As customary, for people who don't have the option
of checking GPG signatures, supplied below are the
SHA1 hashes of released files:
