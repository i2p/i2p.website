The 0.8.6 release contains more peer selection defenses to resist powerful attackers, and tweaks to adjust to the recent rapid growth in the network. Upgrading is recommended.

Please help grow the network. [Get involved](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html), spread the word, and [donate](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)! If you find a bug, please enter a report on [gitlab](http://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.i2p/issues). We are still looking for help on new and existing translations. Please volunteer on IRC #i2p-dev.

Files are available on the [download page](/downloads/).

- Strip trailing nulls from malformed UPnP responses from devices
