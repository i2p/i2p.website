## Update details

0.9.49 continues the work to make I2P faster and more secure. We have several improvements and fixes for the SSU (UDP) transport that should result in faster speeds. This release also starts the migration to new, faster ECIES-X25519 encryption for routers. (Destinations have been using this encryption for a few releases now) We've been working on the specifications and protocols for new encryption for several years, and we are getting close to the end of it! The migration will take several releases to complete.

For this release, to minimize disruption, only new installs and a very small percentage of existing installs (randomly selected at restart) will be using the new encryption. If your router does "rekey" to use the new encryption, it may have lower traffic or less reliability than usual for several days after you restart. This is normal, because your router has generated a new identity. Your performance should recover after a while.

We have "rekeyed" the network twice before, when changing the default signature type, but this is the first time we've changed the default encryption type. Hopefully it will all go smoothly, but we're starting slowly to be sure.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
