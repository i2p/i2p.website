description: "0.9.12 adds support for ECDSA and updates to Jetty 8"
categories: ["release"]
---

I2P now requires Java 6 or higher. We strongly recommend that you upgrade to Java 7. If you are still using Java 5, you must upgrade your Java before installing I2P 0.9.12.

0.9.12 adds preliminary support for ECDSA-signed Destinations. It contains several fixes for the handling of Delivery Status Messages (acknowledgements) and those messages are now end-to-end encrypted for increased security.

We have upgraded to Jetty 8. Jetty 8 is almost identical to Jetty 7, so there are no complex configuration file conversions as there have been in past Jetty upgrades. No manual changes should be necessary.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.

In early March, Internet search company [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) [donated](https://duck.co/blog/foss2014) $5000 to the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) as part of their yearly open-source donation program. The award was granted on the basis of [nominations](https://duck.co/forum/thread/5174/foss-donation-nomations-2014-edition) by members of the public on the DuckDuckGo community portal.

This marks the single largest donation ever received by I2P and reflects a growing interest in privacy and security by the Internet community. The funding will help I2P to reach more users, expand development, and audit the code. It will also enable I2P developers to attend conferences, such as the [Real-World Cryptography](http://www.realworldcrypto.com/) conference in New York City, where the developers met and collaborated with cryptography experts pursuant to I2P's goals of providing anonymity to the public.

I2P thanks Gabriel Weinberg and DuckDuckGo for the generous donation, and the I2P community for its support in the nominations.
