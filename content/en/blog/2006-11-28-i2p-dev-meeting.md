<div class="irc-log">
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; 1) Net status
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; 2) Syndie dev status
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; 3) ???
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi
15:14  * jrandom waves
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001320.html
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; (sorry for the delay, small kitchen emergency)
15:14 &lt;gott&gt; Hello, jrandom.
15:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; heya gott
15:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump in to 1) net status
15:15  * jrandom has nothing more to add for 1) net status, beyond mentioning that i've been connected to irc for 13 days now w/out discon)
15:16 &lt;gott&gt; I have been able to download my favourite modernist movie Metroland from the Frenchmen in #fr via i2psnark
15:16 &lt;gott&gt; Going at download rate of 4400 kb/s; upload around the same.
15:16 &lt;gott&gt; 6 peers.
15:16 &lt;gott&gt; Very good for the propagation of European modernist fiction.
15:16 &lt;jrandom&gt; !thwap
15:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; (or, if you are actually getting 4Mbps, both sides are using 0hop tunnels)
15:17 &lt;gott&gt; bytes a second.
15:18 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else to bring up for 1) net status?
15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump on over to 2) syndie dev status
15:20 &lt;gott&gt; Is it possible to make i2p better somehow in this regard?
15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; gott: oh, you mean 4400 Bps, not kbps?
15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; then i take back the 0hop tunnel thing
15:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; 4KBps is typical atm, and can be improved with better peer selection and congestion management
15:22 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, for syndie dev status, lots of progress going on, as mentioned in the notes
15:23 &lt;jrandom&gt; there's still a bunch of gaps to fill, but they're largely just filling gaps, not writing new components
15:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev status?
15:25 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump on over to 3) ??? then
15:26 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else to bring up in this short meeting?
15:26 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Do you need any money?
15:26 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; oh for fuck sake
15:26 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; well, do you need any money?
15:27 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Do you want a computer?
15:27 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Do you want beer?
15:27 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; What?
15:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; atm, finances are in pretty good shape, though contributions are always appreciated, of course
15:27 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Out with it
15:27 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Alright, then
15:27 &lt;+zzz&gt; post a bounty for emule client :)
15:28 &lt;jrandom&gt; (but if you've got money burning a hole in your poket, it'd be great to snag a mac mini for osx gui testing ;)
15:28 &lt;jrandom&gt; lol zzz
15:28 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Not everyone is a lesbian snob who has a 40 thousand dollar student loan that needs paying off
15:28 &lt;+zzz&gt; keep up the good work jr
15:28 &lt;jrandom&gt; just in case that wasn't closedshop: i appreciate the interest and support, but i won't have any time to work on a file sharing app in the future
15:29 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; Can you implement modulus' lovesoc
15:29 &lt;JosephLeBlanc&gt; ?
