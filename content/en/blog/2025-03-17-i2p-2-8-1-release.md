2.8.1 fixes accesses to local sites that were broken in 2.8.0.
We have added notification bubbles to several applications in the console to highlight application messages.
We fixed a tunnel test bug that may have been affecting tunnel reliability.
The addressbook now has a new "latest" tab that displays the newest hostnames added from your subscriptions.
There are several dark theme fixes and improvements.

We fixed the installer that previously failed on Java 21 or higher.
We also fixed installing to directory paths that contain spaces on Linux.
For those of you that use Docker, we updated outdated Docker container and container libraries.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release.
The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
