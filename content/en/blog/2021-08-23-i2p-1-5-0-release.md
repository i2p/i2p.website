## Update details

Yes, that's right, after 9 years of 0.9.x releases, we are going straight from 0.9.50 to 1.5.0. This does not signify a major API change, or a claim that development is now complete. It is simply a recognition of almost 20 years of work to provide anonymity and security for our users.

This release finishes implementation of smaller tunnel build messages to reduce bandwidth. We continue the transition of the network's routers to X25519 encryption. Of course there are also numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
