We are pleased to offer an Easy Install BETA bundle for Mac OS running on Apple Silicon hardware. You can download it here:

[I2P Mac OS Easy Install bundles](https://geti2p.net/en/download/mac)

**Speed**

In our internal benchmarks the cryptographic operations are between 2 and 2.5 times faster than when running the Intel bundle under Rosetta.

**Known Issues**

- Quitting I2P by right-clicking on the dock icon causes I2P to freeze and a "Force Quit" is necessary. This issue will be fixed for the 1.9 release.
- If you already had an Intel bundle installed on your Mac, you need to modify some settings to prevent in-network updates from reverting you to an Intel bundle. Please see the instructions on the download page.

**Thank you for testing!**
