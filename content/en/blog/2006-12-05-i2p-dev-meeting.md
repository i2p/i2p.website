<div class="irc-log">
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; 1) Net status
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; 2) Syndie dev status
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; 3) iToopie
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; 4) ???
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi
15:00  * jrandom waves
15:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-December/001321.html
15:01 &lt;jrandom&gt; (almost two hours before the meeting, too! :)
15:01 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump on in to 1) net status
15:01 &lt;jrandom&gt; things are going pretty well, no big change on this front
15:02  * jrandom has been connected to irc here for 20 days now, too (a record, i believe)
15:03 &lt;jrandom&gt; not much more to add on this front though atm
15:03 &lt;jrandom&gt; so, if there's nothing else on it, lets jump forward to 2) syndie dev status
15:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; progress continues here, with more bits and bobs becoming workable
15:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; its still quite rough though... "utilitarian", but graphically utilitarian ;)
15:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; the alpha isn't imminent though, but i hope to have it ready soon
15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; in any case, more info as it comes about :)
15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump briefly on over to 3) iToopie
15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; as mentioned in the notes, Thanks y'all!  :)
15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, continuing on in rapid fire to 4) ???
15:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything they'd like to bring up for the meeting?
15:10 &lt;jrandom&gt; (its probably been a year or two since our last 10 minute meeting, but perhaps that's for the best)
15:10 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Hey wow. Totally by accident I am actually present for an I2P meeting.
15:11 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Hi mum!
15:11 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; This is going in the logs right? :)
15:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh yeah ch0 ;)
15:12 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Because of course my mum reads I2P meeting logs...
15:12 &lt;burl&gt; i was going to ask about the licensing but i just read the answer on www.i2p (why not gpl?)
15:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; gpl kills babies
15:13  * jrandom ducks
15:13 &lt;burl&gt; i have to print them out for my mum. she's not very good with computers
15:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; heheh
15:14 &lt;burl&gt; i've been reading all about the free software movement recently. ethically it seems bang on
15:14 &lt;burl&gt; closed source is evil :)
15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; good, evil, they're all the same.  what matters here is that closed source is /insecure/ ;)
15:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; (syndie license summary @ http://syndie.i2p.net/faq.html#license less religious license info for i2p @ http://www.i2p.net/licenses )
15:15 &lt;burl&gt; yeah, that did cross my mind too. if some evil company stole syndie and made a "better" closed version, who'd trust it?
15:16 &lt;jrandom&gt; you can't steal whats free
15:16 &lt;burl&gt; yeah, but i mean made changes to the source and didn't let you see them
15:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; changes to /your copy/ of the source.  my copy of the source is still exactly as it was before, and still exactly as free ;)
15:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; but, yeah, i understand.  disagree, but understand
15:18 &lt;jrandom&gt; all things considered, open source&gt;&gt;closed source, and while gpl has some nasty limits, its sufficient for many things, and open enough for security
15:18 &lt;burl&gt; because no-one would trust the closed version so it could never take over in popularity
15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye
15:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; licence rants are always good ways to fill up 10m of meeting logs ;)
15:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?
15:23 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Well if you need more meeting time - why Java?
15:23 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; I mean ewww!
15:23 &lt;jrandom&gt; !thwap
15:24  * jrandom winds up
15:24  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
