## Update details

The 1.7.0 release contains several performance and reliability improvements.

There are now popup messages in the system tray, for those platforms that support it. i2psnark has a new torrent editor. The NTCP2 transport now uses much less CPU.

The long-deprecated BOB interface is removed for new installs. It will continue to work in existing installs, except for Debian packages. Any remaining users of BOB applications should ask the developers to convert to the SAMv3 protocol.

We know that since our 1.6.1 release, network reliability has steadily deteriorated. We were aware of the problem soon after the release, but it took us almost two months to find the cause. We eventually identified it as a bug in i2pd 2.40.0, and the fix will be in their 2.41.0 release coming out about the same time as this release. Along the way, we've made several changes on the Java I2P side to improve the robustness of network database lookups and stores, and avoid poorly-performing peers in tunnel peer selection. This should help the network be more robust even in the presence of buggy or malicious routers. Additionally, we're starting a joint program to test pre-release i2pd and Java I2P routers together in an isolated test network, so we can find more problems before the releases, not after.

In other news, we continue to make great progress on the design of our new UDP transport "SSU2" (proposal 159) and have started implementation. SSU2 will bring substantial performance and security improvements. It will also allow us to finally replace our last usage of the very slow ElGamal encryption, completing a full cryptography upgrade that started about 9 years ago. We expect to start joint testing with i2pd soon, and roll it out to the network later this year.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
