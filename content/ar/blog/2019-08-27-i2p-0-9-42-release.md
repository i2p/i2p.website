## Update details

0.9.42 continues the work to make I2P faster and more reliable. It includes several changes to speed up our UDP transport. We have split up the configuration files to enable future work for more modular packaging. We continue work to implement new proposals for faster and more secure encryption. There are, of course, a lot of bug fixes also.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
