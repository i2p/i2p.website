categories: ["release"]
---

The 0.7.11 release fixes several issues, some related to clocks, which prevented new routers from quickly integrating into the network. It also fixes the installer for 64-bit Windows. The release includes an update to [Jetty 5.1.15](http://old.nabble.com/jetty-5.1.15,-6.1.18-and-7.0.0.M2-td23652819.html) to fix [this vulnerability](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/402580).

As usual, the release contains more anonymity and performance improvements, and an assortment of bug fixes. Upgrading is recommended.

Please give the developers feedback on IRC #i2p or [forum.i2p2.de](http://forum.i2p2.de/) and [get involved](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html), spread the word, and [donate](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)! We are still looking for help on new and existing translations. Please volunteer on IRC #i2p.

Files are available on the [download page](/downloads/).

Release details:
