## Update details

0.9.36 introduces NTCP2, our new secure transport protocol. NTCP2 provides effective resistance against DPI censorship and results in reduced CPU load. It makes I2P more likely to run on low-end devices such as smartphones and home routers. The protocol is disabled by default in this release for testing.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
