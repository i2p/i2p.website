## Update details

0.9.37 continues work on our new transport NTCP2, which was introduced in the previous release. A new SSU IPv6 peer testing protocol is now supported. The release contains numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
