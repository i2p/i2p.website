## Update details

In the 0.9.43 release, we continue work on stronger security and privacy features and performance improvements. Our implementation of the new leaseset specification (LS2) is now complete. We are beginning our implementation of stronger and faster end-to-end encryption (proposal 144) for a future release. Several IPv6 address detection issues have been fixed, and there of course are several other bug fixes.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
