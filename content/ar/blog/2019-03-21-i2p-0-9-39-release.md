## Update details

0.9.39 includes extensive changes for new network database types (proposal 123). The i2pcontrol plugin is now bundled as a web-app to support development of RPC applications. Several important bugs in streaming, i2psnark, and NTCP2 have been fixed.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
