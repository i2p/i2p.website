## Update details

0.9.40 disables the old NTCP1 transport and removes support for SSU introductions over IPv6. Now that NTCP2 has been enabled by default for over 6 months, it's time to disable the old NTCP1 transport and save bandwidth and memory. We continue development work on LS2 and encrypted leasesets. Several bugs have been fixed.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
