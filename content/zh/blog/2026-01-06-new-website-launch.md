## Launching the Redesigned I2P Website

We are pleased to announce the launch of the redesigned I2P website. This update is the result of a focused effort to make I2P easier to discover, easier to understand, and easier to contribute to—without compromising the values the project is built on.

This work is primarily aimed at the I2P community: long-time users, contributors, developers, researchers, and those discovering I2P for the first time and trying to understand how it fits together.

## Why a Redesign Was Needed

Over time, the previous website had grown difficult to maintain and difficult to navigate. Documentation was fragmented, important information was hard to find, translations were often incomplete, and the experience on mobile or low-bandwidth connections was inconsistent. Incremental fixes were no longer enough.

This redesign was an opportunity to step back and address those issues holistically—improving structure, accessibility, performance, and clarity across the site.

## A Fresh Design

The new website features a clean, modern interface built with accessibility in mind. A consistent visual language, improved typography, and better spacing make content easier to read. Both light and dark themes are available.

Navigation has been reorganized to group related content logically, making it easier to find documentation, downloads, and community resources. The documentation section has been restructured to help new users get started quickly while still providing detailed technical information for developers and researchers.

The site is fully mobile-friendly, with a responsive navigation menu and a language selector that is now accessible on smaller screens.

## Multi-Language Support

I2P serves a global community, and the website now better reflects that reality. Content is available in 13 languages: English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Russian, Czech, German, French, Turkish, Vietnamese, Hindi, Arabic, and Portuguese.

Under the previous system, many pages were untranslated or only partially translated, which created a poor experience for international users. The new structure makes it significantly easier to maintain translations and expand coverage. Machine-translated pages are clearly labeled and include a disclaimer with a link to the English original.

We are grateful to our Transifex volunteers and welcome new translators who want to help improve or refine existing translations.

## New Features

Several new features have been added to improve the experience for users and contributors:

- A dedicated **Get Involved** page outlining ways to contribute, including development, documentation, translation, and community support  
- Improved download pages with clearer, platform-specific instructions  
- Better-organized documentation with a table-of-contents sidebar for longer pages  
- Community polls to gather user feedback  
- Document search functionality on the clearnet site  
- A feature suggestion system to collect community input  

## Technical Improvements

Behind the scenes, the website has been rebuilt from the ground up with a strong emphasis on being lightweight and usable without JavaScript. Many pages are only a few kilobytes in size and load extremely quickly, even on slow or unreliable connections.

The static site generator handles multi-language content efficiently, the build process has been streamlined for faster deployments, and automated tests help ensure content quality and catch issues before changes reach production. These choices reflect I2P’s broader goals of accessibility, resilience, and privacy.

## Supporting the Project

To help sustain ongoing development and infrastructure, I2P is now accepting donations. Contributions support hosting, development, documentation, and other project costs. For U.S. donors, contributions are considered charitable tax-deductible donations.

If you are able and interested in supporting the project, more information is available at:   https://i2p.net/donate

## What Comes Next

This launch is a starting point, not an endpoint. We will continue improving documentation, expanding translations, and refining the site based on community feedback.

如果您发现问题、缺失信息或可以改进的地方，请通过论坛或 Github Issues 告知我们。I2P 许多最具影响力的改进都直接来自社区的反馈。

Thank you to everyone who contributed time, effort, and feedback to this redesign, and to the broader I2P community for continuing to build and sustain the network.
