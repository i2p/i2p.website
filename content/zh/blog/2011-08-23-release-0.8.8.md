I2P 0.8.8 版本启用了新的 hosts.txt 数据库，以加快主机名解析并在主机名条目中存储附加信息。它还包含改进，使 router（I2P 路由节点）在启动时更快地接入网络。新增代码可检测并响应较大的时钟跳变，这有助于在计算机挂起/恢复后让 router 恢复。

新增了丹麦语和乌克兰语的翻译，并对其他语言进行了大量更新。当然，还包含大量的错误修复、性能改进，以及用于应对网络持续快速扩张的更新。

请帮助壮大网络。[参与其中](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html)、帮助宣传，并[捐款](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)！如果你发现了缺陷（bug），请在[gitlab](http://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.i2p/issues)提交报告。我们仍在寻求对新增与现有翻译的帮助。请在 IRC #i2p-dev 报名志愿参与。

## 版本详情

## 重大更改

- Enable new hosts.txt database for 10x faster lookups and ability to store additional information about entries. The database is created on upgrade, and populated with entries from the hosts.txt, privatehosts.txt, userhosts.txt files. Do not edit your *hosts.txt files manually after the upgrade; you must use the addressbook interface in the router console to add or delete entries.
- (New installs only) Wrapper and jbigi support for ARM v5 processors. The support added in 0.8.7 only worked for ARM v7 processors. We now support both.
- (New installs only) Wrapper and jbigi support for 64 bit x86 and PPC processors for OSX, and PPC for Linux. The support added in 0.8.7 only worked for 32-bit processors on OSX. We now support both.

## 错误修复

- Fix some Null Pointer Exceptions in the console at startup
- Fix some problems with wrapper interaction at shutdown
- Fix several issues with "soft" restart, used when the network configuration changes, or when IP changes in "laptop mode"
- Fix problems with tunnel tests after the tunnel pool is shut down
- Rename the private key file for a tunnel after deleting the tunnel, so it isn't inadvertently reused when a new tunnel is created
- Fix several hosts database file bugs, and add improved corruption detection and recovery
- Fix cases where thread dump wouldn't work
- Speed up network integration for new routers and routers that had been stopped for a long time
- Fix a bug which would leave UPnP ports open after shutdown
- Fix UPnP errors when running on computers with multiple network interfaces
- Fix some of the character encoding issues in susimail (still has some problems)
- Change several log errors to warnings

## 其他

- Lots of improvements in the router shutdown code
- Improvements in recognizing and reacting to large clock shifts (generally caused by system suspend / resume). There are still issues remaining. Large clock shifts now cause a "soft" restart.
- Increase the number of floodfills again
- Increase the number of fast peers for those with several local destinations
- Increase the default news fetch time, which will extend the network upgrade period
- Add the router version to the update file zip signature to prevent version spoofing
- Support readonly hosts database files
- Remove floodfills from the exploration search message, which will help exploration work much better
- Increase the netdb exploration speed when starting up, to help new routers integrate more quickly
- Speed up the enumeration of floodfill routers
- Several other performance improvements
- New Danish and Ukrainian translations
- Translation updates for Chinese, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish and Swedish
