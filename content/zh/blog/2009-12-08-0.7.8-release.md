categories: ["release"]

版本 0.7.8 包含对 router 控制台翻译的初步支持，并对 floodfill 系统进行了更改，为网络的大规模增长奠定了基础。

为防止恶意防火墙轻易封锁 I2P，本次发布对新安装随机分配 I2P 端口。对于现有安装，请将 UDP 端口从 8887 改为随机端口，并在必要时调整防火墙设置，以帮助那些容易被封锁的用户。

此版本还包含更多用于降低内存和 CPU 占用的更改，以及大量的错误修复。建议升级。我们特别鼓励仍在运行 0.7.6 或更早版本的用户尽快升级。请在 IRC #i2p 或 [forum.i2p2.de](http://forum.i2p2.de/) 上向开发者反馈，并[参与贡献](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html)或[捐助](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)！我们也在寻找新旧翻译方面的帮助。请在 IRC #i2p 报名参与。

## 发布详情：

### Network Database

- Partially reintroduce Kademlia to the network database, by having each floodfill store only a portion of the keyspace. Routers will query and store to a floodfill that is closest to the key in question. Floodfills will only flood to peers closest to the key.
- The limit on number of floodfills will not be raised in this release. Therefore, there will be no immediate change; all floodfills will store the entire keyspace. In future releases, the limit will be raised until most class O routers will be floodfill. After that, each floodfill be responsible for about 300 netdb entries, independent of network size, thus allowing i2p to scale to many thousands of routers.
- The release also fixes a bad bug that was preventing verification of RouterInfo stores.

### 网络数据库

- The router console now supports translation to other languages using standard "po" files. Initial string tagging by "walking".
- The HTTP proxy now supports translated error pages.
- Chinese translation (by "walking") is included.
- French translation (by "neutron") is included.
- German translation (by "echelon") is included.
- Translation of bundled applications (i2psnark, i2ptunnel, susimail, susidns) is not yet supported, it will be included in a future release.
- We are searching for additional translation volunteers.

### Router 控制台翻译支持

- Improve the handling of immediate ack requests, hopefully this will help network speed.

### 流式传输库

- Additions to store statistics on netdb performance, to assist floodfill peer selection
- Reduction in storage for non-floodfill peers, to save about 2MB RAM

### 对等节点档案

- To prevent easy blocking by malicious firewalls (matching source or destination port 8887), new I2P installs will now use a random port between 9000 and 32000. Users who have previously installed i2p are encouraged to change their port to make blocking more difficult.

### 传输

- Raise piece size limit from 1MB to 2MB

### I2PSnark

- Continued cleanup of the code to reduce package size and memory usage
- Continued console cleanup
