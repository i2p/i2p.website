## 会议记录

<div class="irc-log"> 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; 1) Net status 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; 2) Syndie dev status 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; 3) I2Phex mods 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; 4) ??? 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi 15:07  * jrandom waves 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001318.html 15:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; (i'm late, so i'll let y'all catch up on those) 15:09 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump on in to 1) net status 15:10 &lt;jrandom&gt; [eom] :) 15:10  * jrandom has had a good irc connection now (4+ days), so things are in pretty good shape. 15:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; we've also got those new peer capacity graphs on stats.i2p, detailing some interesting ratios  15:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 1) net status? 15:14 &lt;striker&gt; just that it looks nice. 15:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; w00t :) 15:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, lets hop on over to 2) syndie dev status then 15:15 &lt;green&gt; I dunno U can have 4+ days conection on IRC,, I'm disconnected somewhat every 24h even with a router not so overloaded 15:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; green: unfortunately, its pretty arbitrary. 15:16 &lt;jrandom&gt; (or, more precicely, the cause is dependent upon many factors without a good control over them) 15:17 &lt;green&gt; any chance to really know why ? 15:17 &lt;green&gt; I've plenty of tunnels even where IRC goes down 15:18 &lt;green&gt; s/when 15:18 &lt;jrandom&gt; yes, there's lots we can do, but i'm focusing my time on getting syndie out first 15:18 &lt;green&gt; I know, so I've just to way more ;) 15:19 &lt;green&gt; s/wait 15:20 &lt;green&gt; gr f..ing keyboard 15:20 &lt;green&gt; ok, no more on 1 let's got to 2 15:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; w3rd 15:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, not much more to add beyond whats in the notes (well, that can reasonably be brought up) 15:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; the webcaching discussion thread is http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1958 15:22 &lt;green&gt; is there any plan on phpbb to syndie converter ? 15:22 &lt;jrandom&gt; and the latest mockup image referred to is http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/mockup/forum.png 15:23 &lt;jrandom&gt; green: hmm, i thought we discussed that in one of the meetings, but looking back at the logs, it occurred outside of a meeting 15:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; short answer: doable, and maybe it'll get done, but its not on the immediate roadmap 15:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; at least, not bidirectional phpbb&lt;--&gt;syndie operation 15:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; phpbb--&gt;syndie is easy (just suck in the posts, or use server side generation) 15:25 &lt;jrandom&gt; syndie--&gt;phpbb is easy too 15:25 &lt;jrandom&gt; i'm not sure if the phpbb model of operation is what people will end up using syndie for though 15:25 &lt;jrandom&gt; but we'll see 15:28 &lt;green&gt; even just an phpbb -&gt; syndie would be enough 15:30 &lt;jrandom&gt; cool, that'll be trivial (pulling phpbb's rendered html into a page & posting it).  a bit more complex would be pulling from phpb's database itself, though that'd give more control (but then only the phpbb admin could do it - the former method can be done by anyone) 15:31 &lt;badger&gt; phpbb's admin is fairly flat.... not a challenge to get a hook of 15:32 &lt;badger&gt; and there are various rss plugins available for it 15:33 &lt;jrandom&gt; ah cool.  actually, if someone wanted to start looking into that, it'd rule - just generate an HTML page (and if you need to reference other resources, do so with the syndie URIs [syndie.i2p.net/spec.html#uri]  15:34 &lt;jrandom&gt; (and if you need images/etc, just reference them as img src="attachment1" etc) 15:34 &lt;jrandom&gt; (and then we can shove 'em into a syndie post with no problem) 15:35 &lt;jrandom&gt; currently the message editor has "add text page" and "add html page" features... eventually we can toss in an "add page from the web..." that prompts you for a URL to fetch 15:37 &lt;badger&gt; http://forum.i2p/rss_news.php 15:38 &lt;badger&gt; translating that to syndie markup would probably be straightforward 15:39 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye (though remember, syndie markup /is html/.  the uris are just... long and hard to read :) 15:41 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev? 15:42 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, lets jump to 3) i2phex mods 15:43 &lt;jrandom&gt; strike1 / Complication: wanna give us an update? 15:43 &lt;strike1&gt; I did a quick sanity check in regards to solving the connect to self problem 15:43 &lt;strike1&gt; http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1965 15:44 &lt;strike1&gt; It seems to be working okay, but is merely preventing the local dest from being added to i2phex.hosts 15:44 &lt;strike1&gt; I am also looking into the hashing problems, and the downloading issues 15:45 &lt;jrandom&gt; kickass! 15:45 &lt;strike1&gt; The new mods in cvs seem to make for a slightly better i2phex so far too, I must say. 15:48 &lt;strike1&gt; Hopefully between Complication, I, and anyone else who wants to help we can solve them all soon. :) 15:49 &lt;jrandom&gt; wikked, thanks strike1 (& complication et al!) 15:50 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 3) i2phex mods? 15:51 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, lets jump to 4) ??? 15:51 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else they'd like to bring up for the meeting? 15:54 &lt;green&gt; any chance to have a dijjer port on I2P ? 15:55 &lt;green&gt; wow, don't worry, just a simple question ;) 15:55 &lt;jrandom&gt; probably not (dijjer port being a large number of public squid outproxies that cache) 15:56 &lt;jrandom&gt; but the ability to have content hosted when you're not online will be there with syndie 15:56 &lt;jrandom&gt; (and syndie can run over i2p) 15:56 &lt;green&gt; sure but how syndie can handle large content ? 15:57 &lt;jrandom&gt; technically, yes, but practically, no 15:58 &lt;green&gt; so using cache is not a so bad idea ? 15:58 &lt;jrandom&gt; otoh, we can have syndie distributed .torrent files for torrents that are encrypted with session keys that only those authorized on syndie know 15:59 &lt;jrandom&gt; there's a use case for caching large files, though i'm not sure if the freenet/dijjer caching method is the best route 15:59 &lt;jrandom&gt; (no pun intended) 15:59 &lt;green&gt; humm .torrent files so we have to rely on a cetral server / tracker 15:59 &lt;green&gt; s/central 16:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; (for instance, see http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#redblue ) 16:01 &lt;jrandom&gt; green: torrents can be distributed, and you can put the same data on lots of swarms 16:01 &lt;jrandom&gt; but functionally, we know that torrents work for transfering truckloads of data 16:03 &lt;green&gt; There isn't so much goo tracker on I2P, so currently we rely on a central server even if it's doable to distribute torrent over a lot of tracker 16:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm, the trackers we have are good, there just isn't that much content :) 16:06 &lt;strike1&gt; I agree though looking at postman's tracker I was impressed with what I found there as opposed to last year. 16:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye, quite 16:07 &lt;strike1&gt; Lots of nice stuff :) 16:09 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anything else for the meeting? 16:10 &lt;green&gt; (baf) :) 16:10  * jrandom winds up 16:10  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed </div>
