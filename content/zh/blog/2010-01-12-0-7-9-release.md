0.7.9 修复了数个长期存在、导致消息损坏的 bug。我们希望在其广泛部署后，网络性能会有所提升。还有其他更改应有助于提高 router 的可达性和 tunnel 构建成功率。该版本还包括更多的翻译支持，以及由 "forget" 完成并由 "russiansponsor" 赞助的完整俄语翻译。

还有更多旨在降低内存和 CPU 使用率的更改，以及其他错误修复。建议升级。请在 IRC #i2p 或 [forum.i2p2.de](http://forum.i2p2.de/) 向开发者反馈，并[参与其中](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html)或[捐助](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)！我们仍在为新的和现有的翻译工作寻求帮助。欢迎在 IRC #i2p 报名成为志愿者。

版本详情：

## 传输与Tunnels

- Fix three bugs, each several years old, causing corrupted tunnel messages. The fixes will hopefully improve network speed.
- Fix a bug preventing firewalled routers from finding introducers. This fix should help network connectivity.
- Improve the algorithm for dropping messages when overloaded at the inbound gateway.
- Fix the error messages on the console when the computer is completely disconnected from the network.
- Fix the way excessive clock skew is calculated and reported.
- Increase the tunnel build timeout, which will improve build success rate.
- Prioritize tunnel builds so pools that most need tunnels build first
- New experimental "laptop mode" for enhanced anonymity when changing locations

## Router 控制台翻译支持

- New Russian translation by "forget" with support from "russiansponsor"
- Translation support added for i2psnark, i2ptunnel, and susidns.
- Several updates to translations.
- We are searching for additional translation volunteers.

## I2CP

- Where possible, keep client-router communications within the JVM rather than going through an external socket, for performance.

## HTTP 代理

- Where possible, keep client-proxy communications within the JVM rather than going through an external socket, for performance.
- Allow configuration of the jump server list

## 其他

- Reduce startup time by 10-15s
- Continued improvements to reduce package size and memory usage
- Continued console improvements
