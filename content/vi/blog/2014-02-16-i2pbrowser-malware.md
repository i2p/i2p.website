We have recently been made aware of the existence of i2pbrowser.net. This website copies our homepage and download page, and attempts to trick users into downloading Windows malware.

There are several indicators that point to i2pbrowser.net being a malware site:

- The domain was registered on February 10th, 2014.
- The download URLs for Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android etc. all link to the same .exe file.
- The .exe is only 741 KB; the official Windows installer for I2P is 13 MB.

We have not examined the malware ourselves, but it does not appear to be very sophisticated; it is not integrated into or bundled with the I2P software. Information security expert [Lance James](https://twitter.com/lancejssc) posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/lancejssc/status/434768667310821377) labelling it as "a standard dark comet rat".

Spread the word. The only official download locations for I2P are linked on our [download page](/en/downloads/). All I2P download packages are GPG-signed by the [release signing key](https://geti2p.net/en/get-involved/develop/release-signing-key).
