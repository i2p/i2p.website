<div class="irc-log"> 20:58:32  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; dev meeting eh? 20:59:27  -*- dream turns on devo 21:00:25  &lt;welt&gt; dream: ah.. glad you're here too :) 21:00:51  &lt;badger&gt; 0) Hello 21:00:55  &lt;dream&gt; you are? 21:00:58  &lt;badger&gt; 1) I2P 0.7 21:01:02  &lt;badger&gt; 2) Syndie 21:01:06  &lt;badger&gt; 3) Donations 21:01:15  &lt;badger&gt; 4) ???? 21:01:21  &lt;badger&gt; 5) A short poem recital by zzz 21:01:39  &lt;badger&gt; 0) Hello 21:01:53  &lt;altGuest&gt; hi 21:02:00  &lt;badger&gt; welcome all to the #207th dev meeting 21:02:05  &lt;badger&gt; 'lo 21:02:20  &lt;hottuna_&gt; 'lo! 21:02:40  &lt;eche|on&gt; welcome! 21:02:43  &lt;zzz&gt; so, let's start by covering what's happened since April 10 2007, if anything  21:02:48  &lt;badger&gt; Just to put that in perspective it's been nearly 2 years since hte last one 21:03:06  &lt;badger&gt; well... bush is out....obama in.... 21:03:36  &lt;dream&gt; lol USA 21:03:51  &lt;badger&gt; 1) I2P 0.7 21:03:56  &lt;eche|on&gt; I guess the 0.7 release note is a good idea what happend to I2P 21:04:20  &lt;badger&gt; Well it looks like the rollout of 0.7 has gone fairly smoothly 21:04:22  &lt;badger&gt; with about 84% network coverage now 21:04:29  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; not bad 21:04:48  &lt;eche|on&gt; :-) 21:04:48  &lt;hottuna_&gt; How much ahs the network grown since 0.7? 21:04:48  &lt;badger&gt; A big cheer to the dev team and release crew for getting it out of the door 21:04:52  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; one bug i may point out that i and another user have noticed though is 21:04:52  &lt;hottuna_&gt; or even since Christmas? 21:05:21  -*- welt waits for stats.i2p to load.. 21:05:28  -=- Sie sind nun als welterde bekannt 21:05:31  &lt;badger&gt; hottuna_: a fairly slow but steady growth if the stats are anything to go by 21:05:41  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; adding new private hosts in susidns requirs manual editing of the privathosts.txt file 21:06:08  &lt;welterde&gt; zzz: wasn't that the bug you fixed recently? 21:06:18  &lt;welterde&gt; or was that sth different? 21:06:25  &lt;eche|on&gt; the stats shows a steady slow growing 21:06:35  &lt;zzz&gt; yeah, i broke it in 0.7, just fixed it yesterday, will be in -4 21:06:40  &lt;eche|on&gt; welterde: yes, he seens to have fixed it 21:07:05  &lt;badger&gt; something to look forward to in 7.0.1 21:07:14  &lt;welterde&gt; zzz: good.. that's done then 21:07:16  &lt;badger&gt; eerm 0.7.1 21:07:19  &lt;eche|on&gt; more users :-) 21:07:22  &lt;zzz&gt; sorry about that 21:07:35  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; what are you guys going to do about network lag...its a growing problem it seems , on the weekends i2p seems overloaded 21:07:56  &lt;welterde&gt; maybe some more streaming lib tweaks? 21:07:57  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; ethier i think more users is good 21:08:00  &lt;badger&gt; zzz: well you've fixed and improved enough stuff to be allowed the odd breakage :) 21:08:33  &lt;hottuna_&gt; I've suggested motivating user to share by having some ratio indicator on the console 21:08:57  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; that sounds good 21:09:14  &lt;eche|on&gt; network load went big last month 21:09:17  &lt;zzz&gt; freak, i'm looking at tweaking the capacity calculation in the peer profiles just a little, to react better when things get busy. 21:09:20  &lt;eche|on&gt; months, looks fairly well so far 21:09:51  &lt;hottuna_&gt; zzz: wicked :) 21:09:55  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; this may be ambitious bout how about using a cron job in linux or whatever windows uses to volunteer bandwidth to i2p when their computer is not being used 21:10:17  &lt;zzz&gt; these things have to be adjusted with great care though, and it takes a full release cycle to test any change 21:10:21  &lt;hottuna_&gt; a scheduler would be and awesome solution aswell 21:10:24  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; to dumb it down 21:10:28  &lt;badger&gt; The publicity push for release 0.7 seems to have had a marginal effect on numbers, but not nearly the impact I would have hoped for 21:10:41  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; detect when network / cpu is idle and use it/ dont use when it is 21:10:43  &lt;welterde&gt; zzz: that recent addition to I2CP doesn't allow that yet, right? 21:10:52  &lt;badger&gt; some good coverage in german news sites though 21:11:04  &lt;badger&gt; but slashdot/digg/reddit was rather pathetic 21:11:09  &lt;zzz&gt; allow what welterde ? 21:11:29  &lt;welterde&gt; zzz: to change the ratio/up-bw/down-bw from outside the routerconsole 21:11:29  &lt;eche|on&gt; badger: it needs some time for users to get known to it and keep steady with it :-) 21:11:32  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; and a defult auto startup registry entry would be nice or a simple shell script for unix 21:12:04  &lt;zzz&gt; no welterde it has nothing to do with that 21:12:08  &lt;hottuna_&gt; dunno about the pr.. i suppose that our 'brand name' will grow every time we have a new release adn a pr wave to that 21:12:13  &lt;welterde&gt; zzz: thought so :/ 21:12:56  &lt;zzz&gt; hopefully the gulli interview w/ me will be published soon, but I haven't heard from him in a week 21:13:06  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; is i2p ready to ask for volunteer bandwidth from sponsors? (other than me with my tiny connection) 21:13:39  &lt;welterde&gt; hmm.. that might be worth a try 21:13:50  &lt;dream&gt; I don't think anyone has ever said no to volunteered bandwidth. 21:14:12  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; the tor network has a lot of sponsored nodes, but on the other hand a lot of nodes on the same subnet would be suspicious to users and offer someone more control over the network 21:14:37  &lt;welterde&gt; i think we "fixed" that already 21:14:59  &lt;hottuna_&gt; sponsoring would'nt be a bad idea 21:14:59  &lt;hottuna_&gt; jas a simple html tab on the mainpage? 21:14:59  &lt;hottuna_&gt; just* 21:15:05  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; randomly placed nodes by individual volunteers seems to be safer 21:15:05  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; but not as practical 21:15:15  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; most people by nature will leech 21:15:44  &lt;dream&gt; I don't think that's necessarily true unixfr3ak, but it's good to prepare for non-participants. 21:16:21  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; for example 21:16:40  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; someone who just starts the i2p router, and has no idea what it does and runs i2phex 21:16:49  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; constantly downloading 21:17:11  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; mabye the defualt bandwith should be changed 21:17:22  &lt;hottuna_&gt; has been changed in 0.7 21:17:34  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; or users should be asked for connection speed during the install for more accurate bandwith shareing limits 21:18:26  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; or mabye a virus that installs i2p as a backdoor :P 21:18:34  &lt;welterde&gt; heh 21:18:40  &lt;hottuna_&gt; would be a great idea.. the installer should support that, right? 21:19:08  &lt;welterde&gt; the first or the second? :&gt; 21:19:08  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; my joke or asking the connection bandwith? 21:19:23  &lt;welterde&gt; first) probably yes 21:19:26  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; it should be a line or 2 in a config file somewhere 21:19:39  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; the one without the :P 21:20:59  &lt;badger&gt; download limits for users who don't share upstream bandwidth? 21:21:15  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; sounds intresting 21:21:20  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; but 21:21:33  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; i dont think we should go to such desprate measures yet... 21:21:38  &lt;dream&gt; by default it shares up to 100% of the bandwidth unixfr3ak. once it gets a few client tunnels, the majority is spent on intermediate ones. 21:21:45  &lt;welterde&gt; don't routers already punish other routers, who don't route tunnels? 21:22:00  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; yes 21:22:00  &lt;dream&gt; and I think i2p is already load balanced. I sure cannot download more than I upload on the bandwidth tab. 21:22:25  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; i think so but, if many people leech at one time  it will still put a hevy load on the network 21:22:32  &lt;badger&gt; perhaps this is just a case of being more informative to first time users 21:22:35  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; especially if thier ips are dynamic 21:22:46  &lt;eche|on&gt; http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/tot.cgi?a=bandwidthReceiveBps.5m&s=365&u=y 21:22:56  &lt;badger&gt; make it clear that giving back to the network improves your experience 21:23:07  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; yes 21:23:18  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; and to run it when they are not using thier pc 21:23:36  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; insted of just letting thier connection that they are paying for be idle 21:23:51  &lt;dream&gt; most people turn their computers off, it's really sad 21:24:09  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; yes 21:24:12  &lt;dream&gt; paying their ISP per month, when they could instead for the price of 4 light bulbs... 21:24:15  &lt;l00kns33&gt; i think most people understand this -  i even think most people who use i2p are geeks themself ;) 21:24:32  &lt;badger&gt; anyway moving on - anything else to add for 1) I2P 0.7? 21:24:55  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; for now yes 21:25:16  -*- welterde waits for his signal.. 21:25:20  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; but that may change in the future 21:25:25  &lt;eche|on&gt; badger: no 21:25:25  &lt;badger&gt; 2) Syndie 21:25:37  &lt;welterde&gt; ok then :) 21:25:37  -*- badger passes the 70s boom mike over to welterde 21:25:45  &lt;badger&gt; *mic 21:26:15  &lt;welterde&gt; as you may (or may not) i recently finished the effort to apply these patches from MOSFET 21:26:20  &lt;welterde&gt; +know 21:26:35  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; leave e out on the forums i don't use them :P , brb cigarette 21:27:14  &lt;welterde&gt; which should fix some bugs and disable that (imho) b0rked default ui 21:27:26  &lt;welterde&gt; instead the swt one is used, which most users find easier 21:27:42  &lt;badger&gt; &lt;jrandom&gt;w0rd&lt;/jrandom&gt; 21:28:11  &lt;welterde&gt; hmm? 21:28:30  &lt;dream&gt; it's nice to hear someone was working on getting failed synchronizations to retry. 21:28:40  &lt;badger&gt; welterde: sorry, old dev meeting joke 21:28:59  &lt;badger&gt; is there a new public syndie archive somwhere? 21:29:06  &lt;welterde&gt; anyway.. i hope i have time soon to replace that b0rked ;) index thingy 21:29:09  &lt;welterde&gt; badger: yup 21:29:25  &lt;welterde&gt; http://syndie.welterde.(i2p|de)/ 21:29:52  &lt;dream&gt; making it possible to run syndie using a remote database is important I'd say, to make it easier for people to run their own archives. 21:29:54  &lt;welterde&gt; but you can't post there (yet) as it is just a static archive 21:30:47  &lt;welterde&gt; have to that one to the default ones too 21:30:56  &lt;welterde&gt; will do that soonish 21:31:16  &lt;eche|on&gt; so syndie work goes on 21:31:32  &lt;welterde&gt; yup 21:31:54  &lt;welterde&gt; currently trying to profile syndie.. 21:32:29  &lt;welterde&gt; but wasn't able to spend much time in that area though.. 21:32:59  &lt;eche|on&gt; so much work to do... 21:33:14  &lt;welterde&gt; yes :/ 21:33:17  &lt;dream&gt; running syndie in text mode is tricky, since the interface seems to be slipping behind its current behavior 21:33:17  &lt;dream&gt; usually it works if you just leave it in --cli, but when it freezes there's no real indication. 21:33:41  &lt;welterde&gt; yeah.. the cli is b0rked too currently :/ 21:34:00  &lt;welterde&gt; imho we should seperate syndie into multiple parts, eg. libsyndie, gui, cli, ... 21:34:12  &lt;badger&gt; makes sense to me 21:34:19  &lt;welterde&gt; that should make writing custom extensions, etc. easier 21:34:29  &lt;dream&gt; What sort of stuff would libsyndie cover? 21:34:36  &lt;badger&gt; early v0.0.1 syndie's UI was just a top on the cli binary 21:34:48  &lt;badger&gt; but it seems that idea got lost enroute 21:34:55  &lt;dream&gt; it even has the text console today. 21:35:23  &lt;welterde&gt; dream: message decoding, archive syncing, etc. etc. 21:35:34  &lt;welterde&gt; most of the logic 21:36:06  &lt;dream&gt; so libsyndie is pretty much an interface over the database, and maybe the archive/ directory? 21:36:09  &lt;badger&gt; aye, gui, cli and webtop should just be a light wrapper 21:36:10  &lt;welterde&gt; imho we should keep gui/cli seperate from the program logic 21:36:42  &lt;welterde&gt; dream: the archive isn't used to store anything.. it's just used for serving the archive 21:37:02  &lt;dream&gt; I know that. 21:37:14  &lt;welterde&gt; but as cli/webtop use it we should put it into the libsyndie as well 21:37:15  &lt;dream&gt; So I guess only the web server would need to deal with that directory. 21:37:35  &lt;dream&gt; filling it and synching from it, sort of like a postfix mail queue. 21:38:00  &lt;welterde&gt; but we should only generate/sync it, when we are actually using it.. not like now.. 21:38:08  &lt;welterde&gt; where it is always generated/synced... 21:39:18  &lt;dream&gt; I don't see a problem with only using the archive/ directory for the webserver. It's really just a convenience so you can use existing static file serving functionality. 21:40:07  &lt;welterde&gt; there should be a cli command like generate_archive or something like that imho 21:40:57  &lt;welterde&gt; and we should bring that import.cgi back, so we can run a mostly static archive, while still being able to post 21:41:04  &lt;welterde&gt; or... hmmm...  21:41:04  &lt;dream&gt; what would you do with that archive using the client interface? 21:41:15  &lt;welterde&gt; rsync with a remote site? 21:41:26  &lt;welterde&gt; that's how syndie.welterde.(i2p|de) works ;) 21:41:43  &lt;dream&gt; trouble with a static archive is that keeping the filesystem up to date with the database is a task that is similar to designing a database. 21:41:59  &lt;welterde&gt; hmm.. not really 21:42:05  &lt;welterde&gt; as it's one-way only 21:43:17  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; this may be a little off-topic but has anyone considered a datastore function? 21:43:20  &lt;dream&gt; so using a hypothetical --cli someone creates a message. They then generate_archive after creating it? Sounds suspiciously similar to commiting a transaction after inserting. 21:43:52  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; also in i2phex as i told Complication  previously the bitzi lookup in i2phex inst anonymous  21:43:55  &lt;dream&gt; magicbutton() 21:44:04  &lt;welterde&gt; dream: uhm.. no 21:44:17  &lt;dream&gt; ...i2phex checks bitzi.com? that's nuts 21:44:37  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; yes 21:44:39  &lt;welterde&gt; unixfr3ak: there was some work in direction of freenet afair 21:44:43  &lt;dream&gt; welterde, so then their message never goes into the archive/ directory and can't get synchronized... 21:45:20  &lt;welterde&gt; dream: no.. just mean that a transaction is a bit different 21:45:27  &lt;welterde&gt; for example: you don't edit anything 21:45:33  &lt;welterde&gt; (except for the index maybe) 21:46:02  &lt;welterde&gt; generate_archive just dumps the db and updates the indexes while doing that 21:46:41  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; right click a file 21:47:20  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; and view bitzi ticket takes you to the non-anon site 21:47:20  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; lucky my browser is proxyd by i2p, and my alternate one tor 21:47:31  &lt;dream&gt; so how do you get your new database content into the archive? What if syndie dies after inserting a message, but before you save it to the archive/ directory? 21:47:39  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; 0_0 looks like spongebob missed the meeting 21:47:57  &lt;welterde&gt; dream: nothing.. it's just not archive/ 21:48:16  &lt;welterde&gt; but it will be on the next successful run of generate_archive 21:49:01  &lt;dream&gt; what I'd do is let the client run the web server, and the web server checks archive/ and pulls out all the messages in the db not already there. Or just serve the db messages directly. 21:49:23  &lt;dream&gt; generate_archive doesn't seem like the sort of thing you'd want the client to have to keep track of. 21:49:50  &lt;welterde&gt; problem is.. you can't run syndie on every machine 21:50:18  &lt;welterde&gt; for example this server (i2p2.de/welterde.de) has reached it's limited 21:50:36  &lt;welterde&gt; it will heavily swap when i run syndie on it.. 21:50:41  &lt;welterde&gt; so i have to run it locally 21:50:46  &lt;eche|on&gt; yeah 21:51:06  &lt;welterde&gt; no problem if i had reasonable upload... which i don't have 21:51:19  &lt;welterde&gt; which most adsl-users don't have.. 21:51:45  &lt;badger&gt; anyway - good work with the all the patches welterde - can we expect a release in the not-too-distant-future? 21:51:47  &lt;welterde&gt; so it's either a static archive or one that is slow as hell 21:52:08  &lt;welterde&gt; badger: i think i'll switch from a to b (alpha to beta) soonish 21:52:16  &lt;badger&gt; great 21:52:40  &lt;badger&gt; anything else to add about future dev? 21:52:56  &lt;badger&gt; (syndie) 21:53:10  &lt;welterde&gt; n0pe 21:53:19  &lt;welterde&gt; ;) 21:53:24  &lt;badger&gt; righty in that case 21:53:30  &lt;badger&gt; 3) Donations 21:53:49  -*- badger swings the mic over to eche|on 21:54:00  &lt;eche|on&gt; it's open again! 21:54:18  &lt;eche|on&gt; I created a paypal account and linked it on i2p website 21:54:42  &lt;hottuna_&gt; :D 21:54:47  &lt;badger&gt; coolio 21:54:50  &lt;hottuna_&gt; wicked 21:54:52  &lt;eche|on&gt; but the buttons links to https:// sites of paypal, works not for eepsite yet 21:55:01  &lt;dream&gt; yeah I guess that's an advantage welterde 21:55:08  &lt;eche|on&gt; til yet no entry on that front 21:55:20  &lt;welterde&gt; eche|on: maybe you should add some notes on how to tell you what you should do with it 21:55:29  &lt;eche|on&gt; and undecided about a acc for 2ndlive 21:55:31  &lt;zzz&gt; can you add a link from the donate page to the halloffame page, and/or provide more info on what donations will be used for 21:55:39  &lt;dream&gt; I still think whatever creates the archive should synchronize more than just dump. 21:55:48  &lt;badger&gt; yup 21:56:02  &lt;badger&gt; are you planning to support bounties too? 21:56:10  &lt;eche|on&gt; welterde: acked 21:56:13  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; you could just use apache 21:56:17  &lt;welterde&gt; dream: premature optimization ;) 21:56:19  &lt;eche|on&gt; zzz: acked 21:56:24  &lt;dream&gt; oops 3) 21:56:24  &lt;dream&gt; I don't have any money sorry T_T 21:56:28  &lt;eche|on&gt; we need a list of stuff to buy/not to buy with donations 21:56:37  &lt;zzz&gt; and shouldnt echelon and welterde subscriptions really be listed as expenses instead?

22:04:49  &lt;welterde&gt; badger: of course! 22:05:06  &lt;welterde&gt; unixfr3ak: you have to open a client tunnel and connect to that with a telnet/mud client 22:05:08  &lt;welterde&gt; (or use socks) 22:05:38  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; i dont want to get my socks dirty ill make a tunnel :p 22:05:43  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; hmm 22:05:47  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; but for destination 22:05:50  &lt;badger&gt; muddy socks 22:05:59  &lt;unixfr3ak&gt; does that include the .i2p ?
