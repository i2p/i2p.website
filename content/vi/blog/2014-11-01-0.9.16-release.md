description: "0.9.16 includes crypto migration and many fixes"
categories: ["release"]
---

0.9.16 is a significant step forward in our plan to migrate from DSA to ECDSA and then EdDSA cryptographic signatures, and makes several other changes to increase your anonymity and security. Client tunnels for standard, IRC, and SOCKS IRC will use ECDSA signatures by default. In addition, we've fixed a large number of serious bugs, including console lockups.

Changes in router data structures will require i2pcontrol plugin users to update to version 0.0.9.

If you run an eepsite or a service and you are not running a recent release, or your Java or OS does not support ECDSA (as noted in the logs and on the /logs page in the console), please fix the issue as soon as possible or your users will soon be unable to connect.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.

## RELEASE DETAILS

### Changes

- Add support for stronger Router Info signatures

- Use ECDSA by default for i2ptunnel IRC, SOCKS-IRC, and standard client tunnels
- Don't prefer floodfills in some countries
- New column sorting, set-all priority buttons, and upload ratio display in i2psnark
- Increase i2psnark tunnel default to 3 hops
