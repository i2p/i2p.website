## Update details

0.9.21 contains several changes to add capacity to the network, increase the efficiency of the floodfills, and use bandwidth more effectively. We have migrated the shared clients tunnels to ECDSA signatures and added a DSA fallback using the new "multisession" capability for those sites that don't support ECDSA.

The speakers and the schedule of the I2PCon in Toronto 2015 have been announced. Have a look on the I2PCon page for details. Reserve your seat on Eventbrite.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
