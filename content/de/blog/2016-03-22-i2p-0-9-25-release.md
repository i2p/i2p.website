## Update details

0.9.25 contains a major new version of SAM, v3.3, to support sophisticated multiprotocol applications. It adds QR codes for sharing hidden service addresses with others, and "identicon" images for visually distinguishing addresses.

We've added a new "router family" configuration page in the console, to make it easier to declare that your group of routers is run by a single person. There are several changes to increase the capacity of the network and hopefully improve tunnel build success.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
