## Update details

0.9.30 contains an upgrade to Jetty 9 and Tomcat 8. The previous versions are no longer supported, and are not available in the upcoming Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Zesty releases.

The router will migrate the jetty.xml configuration file for each Jetty website to the new Jetty 9 setup. This should work for recent, unmodified configurations but may not work for modified or very old setups. Verify that your Jetty website works after upgrading, and contact us on IRC if you need assistance.

Several plugins are not compatible with Jetty 9 and must be updated. The following plugins have been updated to work with 0.9.30, and your router should update them after restart: i2pbote 0.4.6; zzzot 0.15.0.

The following plugins (with current versions listed) will not work with 0.9.30. Contact the appropriate plugin developer for the status of new versions: BwSchedule 0.0.36; i2pcontrol 0.11.

This release also supports migration of old (2014 and earlier) DSA-SHA1 hidden services to the more-secure EdDSA signature type.

Note: On non-Android ARM platforms such as the Raspberry Pi, the blockfile database will upgrade on restart, which may take several minutes. Please be patient.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
