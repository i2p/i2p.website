## Update details

0.9.28 contains fixes for over 25 Trac tickets, and updates for a number of bundled software packages including Jetty. There are fixes for the IPv6 peer testing feature introduced last release. We continue improvements to detect and block peers that are potentially malicious. There are preliminary fixes for Java 9, although we do not yet recommend Java 9 for general use.

I2P will be at 33C3, please stop by our table and give us your ideas on how to improve the network. We will review our 2017 roadmap and priorities 2017 at the Congress.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
