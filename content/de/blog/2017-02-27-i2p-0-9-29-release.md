## Update details

0.9.29 contains fixes for numerous Trac tickets, including workarounds for corrupt compressed messages. We now support NTP over IPv6. We've added preliminary Docker support. We now have translated man pages. We now pass same-origin Referer headers through the HTTP proxy. There are more fixes for Java 9, although we do not yet recommend Java 9 for general use.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
