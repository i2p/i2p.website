## Update details

0.9.24 contains a new version of SAM (v3.2) and numerous bug fixes and efficiency improvements. Note that this release is the first to require Java 7. Please update to Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible. Your router will not automatically update if you are using Java 6.

To prevent the problems caused by the ancient commons-logging library, we have removed it. This will cause very old I2P-Bote plugins (0.2.10 and below, signed by HungryHobo) to crash if they have IMAP enabled. The recommended fix is to replace your old I2P-Bote plugin with the current one signed by str4d.

We had a great 32C3 Congress and are making good progress on our 2016 project plans. Echelon gave a talk on I2P's history and current status, and his slides are available. Str4d attended Real World Crypto and gave a talk on our crypto migration.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
