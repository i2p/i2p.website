## Update details

0.9.27 contains a number of bug fixes. The updated GMP library for crypto acceleration, which was bundled in the 0.9.26 release for new installs and Debian builds only, is now included in the in-network update for 0.9.27. There are improvements in IPv6 transports, SSU peer testing, and hidden mode.

We updated a number of plugins during I2P Summer and your router will automatically update them after restart.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
