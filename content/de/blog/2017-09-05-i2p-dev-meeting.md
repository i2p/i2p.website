## Meeting Log

<div class="irc-log"> 20:00:00 &lt;zzz&gt; 0) Hi 20:00:00 &lt;zzz&gt; 1) 0.9.32 update (zzz) 20:00:00 &lt;zzz&gt; 2) 34C3 funding email reminder (zzz/echelon) 20:00:03 &lt;zzz&gt; 0) Hi 20:00:05 &lt;zzz&gt; Hi 20:00:44 &lt;zzz&gt; 1) 0.9.32 update (zzz) 20:00:58 &lt;R4SAS&gt; Hi 20:01:09 &lt;zzz&gt; ok, str4d has done some UI updates, and I've started on the prop 141 implementation but haven't checked anything in yet 20:01:37 &lt;zzz&gt; we're on track for an early october release 20:01:49 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] Hi 20:02:03 &lt;zzz&gt; I think str4d wants to prop his benchmark branch, he should do that soon? I've commented in his ticket 20:02:20 &lt;psi_&gt; ay 20:02:36 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] I've only pushed a minor UI tweak thus far; I have more sitting locally that addresses a bunch more issues, but I need to go through my git -&gt; mtn process 20:03:09 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] I'll look at the benchmark comments and finish / push that end of this week 20:03:57 &lt;zzz&gt; ok I need to talk to you at some point about our release process. We had blocker tickets for .31 that weren't closed, probably want to insist that those are closed before a release 20:04:08 &lt;zzz&gt; or else what does blocker even mean 20:04:23 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] Correct 20:04:36 &lt;zzz&gt; anything elase on 1) ? 20:06:01 &lt;zzz&gt; 2) 34C3 funding email reminder (zzz/echelon) 20:06:11 &lt;psi&gt; does this release require removal of hostnames? 20:06:15 &lt;psi&gt; in RI 20:06:25 &lt;psi&gt; gah lag 20:06:33 &lt;zzz&gt; see the proposal text for migration discussion 20:06:45 &lt;psi&gt; kk 20:07:07 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] -1 on it being in this release without discussion of zombie mitigations 20:07:08 &lt;zzz&gt; ok re: 34C3, if you want funding or free ticket you MUST email echelon by Sept. 30 20:07:43 &lt;zzz&gt; in addition, echelon did have some server issues, so if you didn't get an ACK from him that he got your email, send it again 20:08:46 &lt;zzz&gt; we have plenty of funds available for people but you must ask. We won't be funding people who ask after the end of the month 20:09:48 &lt;zzz&gt; so again make sure that echelon has acknowledged receipt of your request 20:10:03 &lt;zzz&gt; we will set the budget at next month's meeting 20:10:19 &lt;zzz&gt; anything else on 2) ? 20:10:36 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] Not from me. 20:11:26 &lt;zzz&gt; anything else for the meeting? 20:11:54 &lt;psi&gt; i have something 20:12:02 &lt;zzz&gt; psi go 20:12:03 &lt;psi&gt; but it's long and teedious 20:12:09 &lt;psi&gt; it's that aligned outbound tunnels idea 20:12:36 &lt;psi&gt; originally i sold it to you as a OBEP load reduction technique 20:12:45 &lt;psi&gt; that is a nice side effect 20:12:53 &lt;psi&gt; but that is not the original intent 20:13:10 &lt;psi&gt; the original intent was to reduce packet drop 20:13:59 &lt;zzz&gt; ok, so what would you like to discuss about it? 20:14:08 &lt;psi&gt; my question is: would java i2p implement aligned outbound tunels ? 20:14:22 &lt;psi&gt; or is it too experimental for you? 20:14:53 &lt;psi&gt; i am not as familiar with java i2p's code as i am i2pd's 20:14:57 &lt;zzz&gt; can't answer now because I forgot the details. If you write it up and post it somewhere I'll be happy to give you an answer 20:15:09 &lt;psi&gt; okay 20:15:15 &lt;psi&gt; i guess you can close meet 20:15:26 &lt;psi&gt; the idea is OBEP == IBGW 20:15:35 &lt;psi&gt; with an extra hop on the OB tunnel 20:15:38 &lt;eche|offf&gt; nothing from me so far 20:15:43 &lt;psi&gt; such that OBEP == IBGW 20:16:14 &lt;psi&gt; to reduce packet drop and OBEP pressure 20:16:30 &lt;psi&gt; (at the expense of more tunnels) 20:16:51 &lt;zzz&gt; ok, since you've already implemented it, any data on the benefits would be very helpful 20:17:10 &lt;zzz&gt; anything else on aligned outbound tunnels? 20:17:31 &lt;psi&gt; my initial observations of it is the initial RTT is the same as after 20:17:44 &lt;psi&gt; rather, there is no initial RTT spike 20:17:57 &lt;psi&gt; possibly because of the release of pressure on OBEP 20:18:03 &lt;psi&gt; but that is just an assumption 20:18:15 &lt;psi&gt; i want to test this on a testnet, of which we have with docker. 20:18:25 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] If there's something we can turn into a performance benchmark, LMK 20:18:25 &lt;psi&gt; to collect hard numbers etc 20:19:01 &lt;psi&gt; yeah same here, i am at a loss for a good perf benchmark 20:19:18 &lt;psi&gt; i have been using icmp ping over openvpn 20:19:23 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] Actually this would be more like a metric, since it would depend also on network performance, and would likely differ depending on endpoint locations 20:19:27 &lt;psi&gt; probably not the best way 20:19:48 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] But if we *can* make a repeatable benchmark, I'd want to add it to the suite I plan to start collecting 20:20:18 &lt;psi&gt; what i use right now is, time to connect via dtls and then the following latency measurement via ping 20:20:31 &lt;psi&gt; that isn't porable for java i2p i think 20:20:45 &lt;psi&gt; unless socks5 udp works 20:20:49 &lt;psi&gt; or i do some SAM stuff 20:21:23 &lt;zzz&gt; anything else on aligned outbound tunnels? 20:21:31 &lt;psi&gt; aligned outbound tunnels is still experimental and idk if the increased tunnel count is worth it or not yet 20:21:49 &lt;psi&gt; so more research needed and it's getting scienced rn over at i2pd 20:21:56 &lt;psi&gt; i'll let you know 20:22:12 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] Great, keep me appraised of the science in #i2p-science :slightly_smiling_face: 20:22:20 &lt;psi&gt; kk 20:22:21 &lt;zzz&gt; great, thanks for the update psi 20:22:25 &lt;zzz&gt; anything else on aligned outbound tunnels? 20:22:53 &lt;psi&gt; one final thing: it may be worth it to do something in addition to aligning tunnels, i.e. something like tor's rend spec 20:23:17 &lt;psi&gt; as for what that is idk and will think about it outloud in #i2p-science 20:23:20 &lt;psi&gt; (please join) 20:23:29 &lt;psi&gt; that's it 20:23:41 &lt;i2pr&gt; [Slack/str4d] All from me 20:23:49 &lt;zzz&gt; anything else for the meeting? 20:24:28 &lt;psi&gt; i am good 20:25:15 &lt;zzz&gt; thanks everybody, see you in 4 weeks, which will be .32 release time 20:26:10 * zzz ***bafffs*** the meeting done </div>
