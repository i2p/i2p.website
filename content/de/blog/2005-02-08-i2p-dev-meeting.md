## Sitzungsprotokoll

<div class="irc-log"> 13:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi 13:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; 1) 0.4.2.6-* 13:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; 2) 0.5 13:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; 3) i2p-bt 0.1.6 13:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; 4) fortuna 13:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; 5) ??? 13:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi 13:06  * jrandom waves 13:06 &lt;@duck&gt; y0 13:06 &lt;smeghead&gt; hi 13:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-February/000564.html 13:07 &lt;cervantes&gt; sorry I'm late...I was busy reading the status notes that were posted at the last minute... 13:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; hey, this week they were /before/ the meeting at least (by 30s or so ;) 13:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyway, while you dig through that oh so exciting email, lets jump on into 1) 0.4.2.6-* 13:09 &lt;jrandom&gt; with the latest patches from anon et al, i'm torn between pushing out a new 0.4.2.7 so close to the 0.5 rev.   13:10 &lt;jrandom&gt; for the moment though, if you're feeling brave, feel free to give cvs a whirl - its stable (i'm breaking things off on another branch), and has some good stuff 13:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; the deciding factor for not pushing a rev out was when i did a checklist for 0.5 and found that the only things left were really web interface updates 13:11 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; about the patches from sugadude, they do represent a policy change, as we discussed filtering out non .i2p addresses before, and you decided against it 13:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; oh, hrm?  i disagree with my old self then - eepproxy doesn't accept non-.i2p address in any case, even if they were in hosts.txt 13:12 &lt;jrandom&gt; did i have a convincing argument before? 13:13 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; ok, then can we revert the patch, and I can implement it the way it originally worked, which is a 0 line change? 13:13 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; not really, I just didn't care either way :) 13:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; oh, cool you're the boss 13:13 &lt;cervantes&gt; well you convinced me to drop all my work on a multi-tld management system and fire all my employees 13:13 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; filtering is already happening, so it's just adding a condition to an if statement 13:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; cervantes: there's also this beautiful bridge i've got for sale... 13:14 &lt;cervantes&gt; :) 13:14 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok word Ragnarok, if you want to send me a .java/.tar/.diff/.whatever, that'd be great 13:15 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; I can do cvs now :) 13:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; :) even better 13:15  * cervantes backs up cvs head 13:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh 13:16 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; *BOOM* 13:16 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; ... just kidding :) 13:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, other than that, anyone have anything else to bring up wrt 0.4.*? 13:17 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;dm&gt;gt; 0.4.* sucks, give us 0.5 13:17 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;dm&gt;gt; It's like a gazillion years old!! 13:18 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;fvw&gt;gt; 0.4.* doesn't suck, give us 0.5 anyway. 13:18 &lt;jrandom&gt; 2) 0.5 it is then :) 13:19 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;dm&gt;gt; you guys owe me big time, I brought 0.5 13:19 &lt;jrandom&gt; we couldn't'a done it without ya dm  13:19 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;dm&gt;gt; amen 13:20 &lt;jrandom&gt; as mentioned in the notes, pretty much all the heavy lifting for 0.5 is done and tested, but there are still the odds and ends left to fix up 13:21 &lt;jrandom&gt; (e.g. the next task on my list is a tunnel config page to manage the pools and settings) 13:22 &lt;@duck&gt; I hope we will have a test-0.5 network before releasing? 13:22 &lt;jrandom&gt; there have been updates to lots of different components though, so 0.5 might be a bit bumpy 13:22 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;dm&gt;gt; jrandom HAS a test network already.. duh 13:23 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye, i've been doing one locally here with a dozen routers, but in the next day or two i'll try to snag some people to help with some wide area tests 13:24  * postman can offer a dedicated machine 13:24 &lt;jrandom&gt; wikked.  perhaps we can try something out tomorrow, try to break some things.   13:26 &lt;cervantes&gt; as can I 13:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; word 13:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; thats about all i have to say about the upcoming 0.5 at the moment - the cvs commit logs have been pretty verbose, so if you want the nitty gritty, hit 'em up 13:28 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyone else have any comments/questions/concerns/frisbees wrt 0.5? 13:29 &lt;+postman&gt; no 13:29  * postman is looking forward to get the new V8 running :) 13:30 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; well, 0.5 is more of a new tank - designed to improve security and anonymity, not as a performance tweak ;) 13:30 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; but i agree, its been too long 13:30 &lt;@duck&gt; dont forget to add a 0.5 target to bugzilla 13:30 &lt;@duck&gt; in case there are bugs 13:30 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; (heh, did i even add a 0.4?) 13:31 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; but good call 13:31 &lt;@duck&gt; or would you like bugs elsewhere 13:31 &lt;@duck&gt; err bugreports :) 13:31 &lt;@duck&gt; I know that I have been lazy and abuse irc messages for them 13:31 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; no, bugzilla is great, much better than my notebook 13:32 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; i don't blame you, as bugzilla is a bit of a pain 13:32 &lt;jrandom2p&gt; but as bugs pile up, its for the best 13:32 &lt;@duck&gt; nah 13:33  * jrandom just noticed i'm switching schitzophrenically between screens 13:34 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyway, moving on to 3) i2p-bt 0.1.6 13:34 &lt;jrandom&gt; duck: you've got the mic  13:34 &lt;@duck&gt; ok 13:34 &lt;@duck&gt; i2p-bt 0.1.5 had some issues, the two biggest ones: 13:35 &lt;@duck&gt; - resource temporarily unavailable 13:35 &lt;@duck&gt; - invalid argument error on windows 13:35 &lt;@duck&gt; both have been fixed 13:35 &lt;jrandom&gt; (yay!) 13:35 &lt;@duck&gt; while I tried to blame the sam protocol, the sam bridge and winsock 13:35 &lt;@duck&gt; the problem turned out to be related to non-blocking socket code 13:36 &lt;@duck&gt; I yet have to see 0.1.6 crash 13:36 &lt;@duck&gt; some other issues are not addressed: 13:36 &lt;@duck&gt; the GUI users have been complaining about the popups 13:36 &lt;@duck&gt; you can comment them out, but I didnt like that 13:37 &lt;@duck&gt; still waiting for someone to implement a better solution 13:37 &lt;@duck&gt; like showing a status line on the transfer window itself 13:37  * smeghead hides 13:37 &lt;smeghead&gt; i looked at that last night actually 13:37 &lt;smeghead&gt; but it's not at the top of my priority list 13:37 &lt;@duck&gt; or maybe one day I will look into how wxPython works and do it myself 13:37 &lt;@duck&gt; but it's not at the top of my priority list 13:38 &lt;@duck&gt; and I dont use the GUI, so I dont really care :P 13:38 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; there's always the new gui from 3.9 :) 13:38 &lt;@duck&gt; is it any better? 13:38 &lt;smeghead&gt; yes why did you base i2p bt on such a crusty version in the first place? :) 13:38 &lt;@duck&gt; because it was the stable release at that moment 13:39 &lt;@duck&gt; and not as mutilated as clients like bittornado 13:40 &lt;@duck&gt; Ragnarok: ignoring licensing issues, I think that porting our i2p things to 3.9 might be good 13:40 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; the new gui is pretty awsome, imho, and it's written using pygtk, so I can actually hack on it 13:40 &lt;jrandom&gt; what's 3.9's license?  i thought it was mit-esque? 13:40 &lt;+protokol&gt; i would love a more recent jetty version 13:40 &lt;smeghead&gt; protokol: that's coming sooner than you think 13:41 &lt;@duck&gt; "BitTorrent Open Source License" 13:41 &lt;smeghead&gt; flavor of the month license 13:41 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; I haven't read all of it.. it seems odd 13:41 &lt;+protokol&gt; licencing does not exist on i2p 13:41 &lt;@duck&gt; derived from the Jabber Open Source License 1.0 13:41 &lt;+protokol&gt; if there is source, its PD 13:41 &lt;@duck&gt; protokol: that is why I said 'ignoring' 13:42 &lt;smeghead&gt; and the jabber license is based on? 13:42 &lt;jrandom&gt; (out of date copyright laws?) 13:42 &lt;smeghead&gt; besides that :) 13:43 &lt;modulus&gt; Sun's wish to fuck about. 13:43 &lt;@duck&gt; http://www.opensource.org/licenses/jabberpl.php 13:43 &lt;smeghead&gt; i move we schedule the licensing issue for the next meeting of the I2P Public Domain Security Council 13:43 &lt;modulus&gt; ah, that one 13:43 &lt;modulus&gt; misheard. 13:45 &lt;@duck&gt; 3.9.0 looks hot 13:45 &lt;@duck&gt; it is still beta though 13:47 &lt;@duck&gt; ok, those willing to help, please let me know 13:47 &lt;@duck&gt; so we can look into using 3.9.x 13:47 &lt;@duck&gt; . 13:47 &lt;jrandom&gt; w3rd 13:47 &lt;smeghead&gt; i'm willing to help out 13:47 &lt;jrandom&gt; i'm willing to help test 13:48 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; I'm willing, but there are likely to be time constraints, as I am currently having the semester from hell. 13:48 &lt;jrandom&gt; d'oh 13:48 &lt;@duck&gt; drop out 13:48 &lt;jrandom&gt; damn, duck beat me 13:48 &lt;smeghead&gt; yes, everyone does it 13:49 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; boo 13:49 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; just join the military ;) 13:50 &lt;jrandom&gt; yeah, as that'll give you lots of time to code, 'eh?  ;) 13:50 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; I've already given up on being a math major, that's as much as you're getting from me :) 13:50 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh 13:50 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone else have anything on 3) i2p-bt?   13:51 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; just don't sign up for six years 13:51 &lt;@duck&gt; quite a bit of forum posts on it 13:51 &lt;@duck&gt; thanks to those who aid the newbies 13:51 &lt;@duck&gt; s/thanks/my thanks/ 13:51 &lt;@duck&gt; if you have stuff for a FAQ, lemme kno 13:52 &lt;jrandom&gt; (if we still had drupal, we could just add a new node...) 13:53 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyway, moving on to 4) fortuna 13:54 &lt;jrandom&gt; smeghead: wanna give us an update on things? 13:54 &lt;smeghead&gt; yes, i'm working on pants and fortuna in tandem 13:55 &lt;smeghead&gt; since i needed to modify fortuna's build to turn it into a pbuild 13:55 &lt;smeghead&gt; eta on a patch that will let you test fortuna is a day or two, maybe tonight depending on what drugs are involved 13:56 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh 13:56 &lt;@duck&gt; so you'll get your pants down? 13:56 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, cool, whenever is fine - if we get it in for 0.5 in the next week or so, thats great, if not, thats great too 13:56 &lt;smeghead&gt; well even if i finish it tonight, i would take a conservative stance on deployment 13:57 &lt;jrandom&gt; reasonable enough 13:57 &lt;smeghead&gt; until we get some decent testing in 13:57 &lt;smeghead&gt; since this will be at the heart of most of i2p's crypto 13:57 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye 13:57 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; will jbigi stay? 13:57 &lt;smeghead&gt; your new entropy class is cool 13:58 &lt;jrandom&gt; yeah jnymo, this is just a random # generator 13:58 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; ah 13:59 &lt;jrandom&gt; we'll still need to do some research into the quality of various entropy sources in the router, but I think we'll be able to feed it some data. 14:00 &lt;smeghead&gt; btw if anyone wants to read what this pants thing is about: http://smeghead.i2p/README_pants 14:00 &lt;jrandom&gt; oh wikked 14:01 &lt;smeghead&gt; pants is almost done too 14:01 &lt;brachtus&gt; i know jbigi is kinda hard to get working with OS X/Darwin... will this have the same build problems? 14:01 &lt;smeghead&gt; what is the issue on osx? 14:01 &lt;modulus&gt; it's just you have to build the lib 14:02 &lt;modulus&gt; not a big deal imo, but somewhat troublesome. 14:02 &lt;jrandom&gt; brachtus: fortuna is in pure java, doesnt use anything native 14:02 &lt;smeghead&gt; i can put jbigi into pants and that should make building a cinch if we ship pants with i2p 14:02 &lt;brachtus&gt; nothign terribly difficult, it's like building a shared lib on linux, but harder than just double-click-install 14:02 &lt;smeghead&gt; you'd need ant of course 14:02 &lt;brachtus&gt; ok jrandom, that's great :) 14:03 &lt;jrandom&gt; smeghead: thats actually a good point - jbigi has a pants dependency upon GMP 14:03 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; what is pants? 14:03 &lt;smeghead&gt; no manual mucking would be necessary 14:03 &lt;ant&gt; * jnymo doesn't have a router up 14:03 &lt;smeghead&gt; jnymo: read that link i just posted 14:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; http://bolas.mine.nu:8080/cgi-bin/nph-proxy/000000A/http/smeghead.i2p/README_pants 14:04 &lt;smeghead&gt; pants can build gmp too 14:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; (public inproxy) 14:04 &lt;smeghead&gt; ah nice 14:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; yuck, that totally b0rked the text 14:04 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; thanks jr 14:04 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;fvw&gt;gt; aren't you afraid of legal trouble? 14:04 &lt;smeghead&gt; jrandom doesn't run the inproxy 14:04 &lt;jrandom&gt; oh, the inproy is run by someone else, its been posted to the forum 14:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; (see http://bolas.mine.nu:8080/) 14:05 &lt;cervantes&gt; jrandom: it shouldn't be viewed as an html file...check the source 14:05 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;fvw&gt;gt; still, I'm amazed anyone would. But as long as it's being run by someone not vital to the project, fine :) 14:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; hehe 14:05 &lt;jrandom&gt; we're /all/ vital to the project :) 14:06 &lt;smeghead&gt; fvw: i don't see inproxies as legally precarious as outrpoxies 14:06 &lt;smeghead&gt; outproxies even 14:06 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;fvw&gt;gt; Perhaps not, but they can still serve up child porn and such 14:06 &lt;jrandom&gt; only if there were such things on i2p, which, to my knowledge, there isnt  14:06 &lt;legion&gt; outproxies could route through tor, just to be a little safer, since they would just be used for webrowsing I don't see it as a problem. 14:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; (but yeah) 14:07 &lt;modulus&gt; yet 14:07 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;fvw&gt;gt; yeah, but anyone can put it on at any point. 14:07 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;fvw&gt;gt; yeah, I wouldn't run a tor outproxy either. Anyway, sorry for drifting offtopic like that 14:07 &lt;jrandom&gt; legion: yeah, though i tossed up squid.i2p before tor was out 14:07 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;duck_&gt;gt; to get back on topic; looking forward to pants 14:08 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye, pants++ 14:08 &lt;smeghead&gt; i'll let you know before i drop pants on CVS 14:08 &lt;smeghead&gt; it's kinda big 14:08 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;duck_&gt;gt; folks outside of i2p might be interested in it too 14:09 &lt;cervantes&gt; yes let us all know before you drop your pants 14:09 &lt;smeghead&gt; yes, i intend to publicise it outside of i2p also 14:09 &lt;jrandom&gt; agreed, perhaps we should put it in another module (or on the new fast/large server)? 14:09 &lt;+Ragnarok&gt; especially if you're a big pants kind of guy 14:10 &lt;smeghead&gt; yes the pants module really should be kept separate from the pants repo in the source tree, currently i have them located in the same apps/pants root 14:10 &lt;smeghead&gt; :/ 14:10 &lt;smeghead&gt; which i don't have to tell you is total pants 14:11 &lt;smeghead&gt; so what were we talking about originally? 14:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; hmm, we can discuss deployment options offline 14:11 &lt;jrandom&gt; fortuna ;) 14:11 &lt;smeghead&gt; right 14:12 &lt;jrandom&gt; smeghead: have you looked at the AES/SHA256 needs of the impl? 14:12 &lt;jrandom&gt; (as i2p's SHA256 doesn't do partial digests) 14:13 &lt;smeghead&gt; hm 14:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; AES we've got perfectly suitable block impl though 14:13 &lt;smeghead&gt; i guess i'll find out when it blows up 14:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; anyway, we can work those through too 14:13 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh 14:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have any questions/thoughts/concerns on fortuna? 14:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; if not, hopping on over to 5) ??? 14:15 &lt;jrandom&gt; cervantes: p1ng 14:16 &lt;cervantes&gt; http://forum.i2p/viewtopic.php?t=305 14:16 &lt;cervantes&gt; we have a new forum member of the week 14:16 &lt;cervantes&gt; I present [drumroll] Sugadude! 14:16  * brachtus applauds Sugadude 14:17 &lt;jrandom&gt; yay 14:17 &lt;cervantes&gt; for generally being a helpful sod to all those i2p n00bs 14:17 &lt;@duck&gt; nice avatar too 14:17 &lt;cervantes&gt; avatar(s) 14:18 &lt;legion&gt; avatars? didn't know that we could have avatars on the i2p forums? 14:18 &lt;smeghead&gt; only users who are really really bad get them 14:18 &lt;cervantes&gt; you can't...unless you're a forum person of the week ;-) 14:18 &lt;@duck&gt; only for the elite 14:18 &lt;legion&gt; oh, i see... 14:19 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; i know someone was interested in secure financial systems over i2p 14:19 &lt;legion&gt; makes sense :) 14:19 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; don't know if they're here, but... 14:19 &lt;@duck&gt; I am a smelly anarcho capitalist 14:19 &lt;@duck&gt; so try me 14:20 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; i was reading more on threashold cryptography and theres talk about using it for that 14:20 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; as well as securing other functions 14:21 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; everyone familiar with threshold cryptography? 14:21 &lt;legion&gt; IMO that cryptography and network security should be variable, how much should depend on the feature/task. 14:21 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;duck_&gt;gt; jnymo: a bit 14:22 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; well, for trustable financial transactions in i2p, we want strong decentralized trust 14:22 &lt;modulus&gt; is that about the shared keys and shit like that? 14:23 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; yea, keys are shared in pieces 14:23 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;duck_&gt;gt; but in an anonymous environment, how do you know that the entities doing the sharing arent controlled by the same one? 14:23 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; and you need to circumvent more than half of all the servers in the system to obtain the priv key 14:24 &lt;modulus&gt; afaik it's kind of complicated the issue of distributed key generations though. 14:24 &lt;legion&gt; yeah but in a system of millions that would be hard (yeah i2p is small at the moment, but hopefully it will grow much larger soon). 14:25 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; atomic communications, or something.. but yea, theres issues with taking on new nodes on the system, which i thing are being worked out 14:25 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; think 14:25 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; so maybe its not developed enough, but i'd bet some usage of threshold crypto will end up over i2p at some point 14:26 &lt;jrandom&gt; neat 14:26 &lt;legion&gt; dunno, maybe 14:26 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; someone has already built a DNSSEC addon with threshold crypto 14:27 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; and a wrapper around bind 14:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; thresholds work fine when identity is scarce 14:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; in anonymous networks, however, identity is free 14:27 &lt;legion&gt; I'd figure at the moment the highest priority is to get it more user friendly and debugged. 14:27 &lt;jrandom&gt; (want a new destination?  want 100,000?) 14:28 &lt;legion&gt; granted it's cool whenever a new service/feature is developed. 14:28 &lt;jrandom&gt; aye, commerce and finance on top of i2p will be nice 14:28 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; yea, and i wouldn't know if atomic commo would work over a 10000 node threshold crypto sys 14:29 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; well, that's all i had to say :) 14:30 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh cool, definitely feel free to post up neat stuff to the forum or whatnot whenever 14:30 &lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone else have anything for the meeting? 14:32 &lt;+ugha2p&gt; I suck. 14:33 &lt;jrandom&gt; whats up ugha2p? 14:33 &lt;ant&gt; &lt;jnymo&gt;gt; glad you got that off your' chest, ugha ;) 14:33 &lt;+ugha2p&gt; I never remember the meetings. :) 14:33 &lt;jrandom&gt; heh 14:33 &lt;jrandom&gt; well, the logs will be posted soon, 90 minutes of action packed fun 14:34 &lt;jrandom&gt; well, on that note 14:34  * jrandom winds up 14:34  * Curiosity waves to jrandom and stays thank-you! :D 14:34 &lt;ant&gt; * jnymo pitches the meeting ball 14:34  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed </div>
