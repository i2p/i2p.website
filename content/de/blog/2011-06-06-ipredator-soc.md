I have been commissioned to contribute code to I2P during the summer of 2011, implementing a control protocol and a client for this protocol (similar to [Vidalia](https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html) for Tor). This work was the idea of Jan-Erik Fiske of [ViaEuropa](http://viaeuropa.se) and Peter Sunde of [flattr](https://flattr.com) and [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/) fame and its funding will be generously provided by [Relakks](https://www.relakks.com/?cid=gb) and [Ipredator](https://www.ipredator.se/?lang=en).

Current information can be found on [zzz's forum](http://zzz.i2p/topics/888) and #i2p-dev on chat.freenode.net

Cheers
