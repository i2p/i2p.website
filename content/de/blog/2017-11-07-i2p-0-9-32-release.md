## Update details

0.9.32 contains a number of fixes in the router console and associated webapps (addressbook, i2psnark, and susimail). We have also changed the way we handle configured hostnames for published router infos, to eliminate some network enumeration attacks via DNS. We have added some checks in the console to resist rebinding attacks.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
