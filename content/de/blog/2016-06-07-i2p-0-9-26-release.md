I2P is now a proposed site on Stack Exchange! Please commit to using it so the beta phase can begin.

## Update details

0.9.26 contains a major upgrade to our native crypto library, a new addressbook subscription protocol with signatures, and major improvements to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging.

For crypto, we have upgraded to GMP 6.0.0, and added support for newer processors, which will speed up crypto operations considerably. Also, we are now using constant-time GMP functions to prevent side-channel attacks. For caution, the GMP changes are enabled for new installs and Debian/Ubuntu builds only; we will include them for in-net updates in the 0.9.27 release.

For Debian/Ubuntu builds, we have added dependencies on several packages, including Jetty 8 and geoip, and removed the equivalent bundled code.

There's a collection of bug fixes also, including a fix for a timer bug that caused instability and performance degradations over time.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
