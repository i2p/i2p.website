## Update details

The changes in this release are much more noticeable than usual! We have refreshed the router console to make it easier to understand, improve accessibility and cross-browser support, and generally tidy things up. This is the first step in a longer-term plan to make the router console more user-friendly. We have also added torrent ratings and comments support to i2psnark.

As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
