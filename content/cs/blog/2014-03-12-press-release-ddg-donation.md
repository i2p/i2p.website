**Somewhere, NH** -- Internet search company [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) [donates](https://duck.co/blog/foss2014) $5000 to the [Invisible Internet Project](https://geti2p.net/) (I2P) as part of their yearly open-source donation program. The award was granted on the basis of [nominations](https://duck.co/forum/thread/5174/foss-donation-nomations-2014-edition) by members of the public on the DuckDuckGo community portal. With an emphasis on privacy, DuckDuckGo provides a search engine which does not track its users or store personal data. I2P is an anonymous network intended to protect individuals from dragnet surveillance regularly performed by ISPs and governments.

This marks the single largest donation ever received by I2P and reflects a growing interest in privacy and security by the Internet community. The funding will help I2P to reach more users, expand development, and audit the code. It will also enable I2P developers to attend conferences, such as the [Real-World Cryptography](http://www.realworldcrypto.com/) conference in New York City, where the developers met and collaborated with cryptography experts pursuant to I2P's goals of providing anonymity to the public.

I2P thanks Gabriel Weinberg and DuckDuckGo for the generous donation, and the I2P community for its support in the [nominations](https://duck.co/forum/thread/5174/foss-donation-nomations-2014-edition).
