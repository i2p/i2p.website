&lt;zzz&gt; 1) VRP/H1/1119
&lt;zzz&gt; 2) 0.9.26 carryover
&lt;zzz&gt; 3) Summer of X
&lt;zzz&gt; 4) 27-29 deferred to next meeting
&lt;zzz&gt; 0) hi
&lt;zzz&gt; hi
&lt;str4d&gt; hi
&lt;zzz&gt; I'll explain 3) when we get there
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Hi
&lt;zzz&gt; 1) VRP/H1/1119
&lt;zzz&gt; http://trac.i2p2.i2p/ticket/1119
&lt;zzz&gt; has everybody had a chance to catch up and review this ticket?
* str4d is about to post his comments
&lt;zzz&gt; str4d overall thoughts?
&lt;str4d&gt; Overall I think it is pretty good. I like the positive feedback we have had from people who do this kind of thing for a living :)
&lt;zzz&gt; I think we're on the right track more or less
&lt;zzz&gt; this ticket has been around for 2 years. you brought up H1 14  months ago. we've had anonimal's vrp process drafts since september
&lt;zzz&gt; i think over that time, h1 has become pretty legit
&lt;str4d&gt; I agree with zzz that the later points are overspecified, but I think the process and response sections (sections III and IV) are about the right level of specification
&lt;zzz&gt; i have no remaining doubts about using h1
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Yes, although I've only followed the discussion from a distance, vuln. response should follow stricter procedures then now. H1 might be a good options for that.
&lt;EinMByte&gt; s/options/option
&lt;str4d&gt; I am also +1 on h1, for the reasons I have already outlined in the ticket.
&lt;zzz&gt; str4d, you met katie of h1 a while back right? can you fill us in on that meeting?
&lt;z3r0fox&gt; Hi
&lt;str4d&gt; Yeah! I met her at Kiwicon 9
&lt;str4d&gt; I asked her about the tweet I posted, that arice responded to in the ticket
&lt;str4d&gt; Turns out that arice actually emailed her a link to our ticket asking if his response was adequate, and she ended up reviewing the ticket on her phone while in another meeting :P
&lt;str4d&gt; She also liked it :P
&lt;zzz&gt; and what about the funded stuff and what tor's doing with them?
&lt;str4d&gt; She mentioned that it was going to happen, and did indicate that we may be able to get in the same program
&lt;zzz&gt; also, overall impressions of h1 the company after meeting katie?
&lt;str4d&gt; I have yet to follow up on this, because 1) thesis, and 2) there is no point in going in any program if we don't then use h1
&lt;str4d&gt; zzz, very positive
&lt;zzz&gt; anybody have any objections to using h1?
&lt;str4d&gt; They appear to know their stuff, and Katie is certainly thriving there
&lt;zzz&gt; can we flip the switch on h1 now to go live or what has to happen first?
&lt;str4d&gt; If we go for h1, this is what I think needs to happen:
&lt;str4d&gt; - We finish up the VRP and get it on the website
&lt;str4d&gt; - We tidy up the copy text front page of the h1 page
&lt;str4d&gt; (things like how we respond, what we consider in-scope etc.)
&lt;zzz&gt; vrp must be before h1 live?
&lt;str4d&gt; - We decide on the response team
&lt;str4d&gt; - We move the sandbox into closed beta, where we have a few researchers invited
&lt;str4d&gt; - Once we have had some time to get used to the platform, response volumes etc. we take it to open
&lt;zzz&gt; you really think responses are going to start rolling in the day we flip the switch?
&lt;str4d&gt; They could
&lt;str4d&gt; Katie indicated to me there were a number of researchers who were very interested in helping open-source projects, if they could find them
&lt;zzz&gt; can't imagine we need to have everything lined up. not like the researchers are going to start hacking on day one
&lt;zzz&gt; especially if no money involved
&lt;zzz&gt; closed beta means they have to let the in?
&lt;str4d&gt; Yes
&lt;str4d&gt; Essentially h1 invites maybe 10 researchers to be able to use our page
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Do you have any idea who would be invited?
&lt;zzz&gt; so putting the VRP and our response team aside for the moment, who's going to fix up our h1 page to get ready? str4d?
&lt;str4d&gt; I don't recall the exact specifics
&lt;str4d&gt; (whether we invite people ourselves through h1 or whether they find the researchers from the existing registered pool)
&lt;str4d&gt; The idea is that then we don't get inundated with crappy tickets before getting used to how to respond to them
&lt;str4d&gt; But IMHO it also helps us start to directly build relationships with a few researchers
&lt;zzz&gt; do you have a sense of whether everybody is chasing after bounties on h1 or are the free ones getting a lot of reports too?
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Sure, or at least with those that are using h1
&lt;str4d&gt; I don't personally have a sense of that
&lt;EinMByte&gt; zzz: Is there a possibility of eventually oferring bounties?
&lt;str4d&gt; But Katie indicated that there were definitely researchers who wanted to help FOSS projects if they could identify them
&lt;zzz&gt; somebody is funding tor bounties now, so yes
&lt;sadie&gt; I can help str4d on the h1 mainpage
&lt;str4d&gt; thx sadie
&lt;EinMByte&gt; I2P has reasonable savings, why not spend some of them on bounties
&lt;zzz&gt; ok great, so sadie and str4d will work on getting the h1 side ready
&lt;str4d&gt; EinMByte, yes we could go to bounties, but not initially IMHO
&lt;zzz&gt; 1mb we certainly can if we want
&lt;zzz&gt; anything else on h1 or can we move onto the vrp itself?
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Let's see how it works out without bounties
&lt;str4d&gt; And as mentioned above, there is now a program on h1 for funding bounties for FOSS projects
&lt;z3r0fox&gt; Beta sounds like a good opportunity for team to develop public facing responses for if a really serious bug is publically disclosed
&lt;str4d&gt; which we may be able to get into
&lt;zzz&gt; last call for h1
&lt;zzz&gt; ok, lets look at the vrp itself in the ticket
* str4d posts his comments
&lt;zzz&gt; we're reviewing anonimal's draft from november
&lt;zzz&gt; let's not go thru point by point though
&lt;zzz&gt; overall impressions on the november draft and where we go from here?
&lt;str4d&gt; &lt;str4d&gt; I agree with zzz that the later points are overspecified, but I think the process and response sections (sections III and IV) are about the right level of specification
* zzz takes a minute to read str4d's comments
&lt;zzz&gt; ok it seems like we are in general agreement that the november draft is a great start and we have rough agreements on the edits necessary
&lt;zzz&gt; what I'd like to do is take the final stage of this from anonimal, that str4d and I will finish the edits and get it posted on the website, and round up a team
&lt;str4d&gt; Sounds good
&lt;zzz&gt; what do you guys think?
&lt;str4d&gt; There are also the necessary tweaks now we are going for h1 instead of private Trac
&lt;zzz&gt; any volunteers to help us work on the final version?
&lt;zzz&gt; we don't want to get overly tool-specific (mtn, h1, etc) in the process. It should be high level enough to avoid most of that
&lt;str4d&gt; True
&lt;str4d&gt; And we will be iterating on it anyway
&lt;zzz&gt; doesnt need to be perfect out of the gate
&lt;str4d&gt; That is another reason for a private beta initially
&lt;zzz&gt; ok str4d when are we going to have that done by?
&lt;sadie&gt; vrp draft looks good
&lt;zzz&gt; end of march?
&lt;str4d&gt; sounds good
&lt;zzz&gt; ok anything else on 1) ??
&lt;zzz&gt; moving on to 2) 0.9.26 revisited
&lt;zzz&gt; any other comments? unfortunately I haven't updated the roadmap on the website yet
&lt;zzz&gt; so i could hold up my notes to the camera
&lt;zzz&gt; sorry i should have done the website.
&lt;zzz&gt; I did get the last 3 meeting logs, including last thurs and fri., up on the website though
&lt;zzz&gt; guess i will be doing that until kytv reappears
&lt;zzz&gt; whenever our next meeting is, I will put .26 on the agenda to look at it then
&lt;zzz&gt; anything else on 2) ?
&lt;zzz&gt; ok moving on to 3) summer of x
&lt;zzz&gt; str4d can you explain our idea please
&lt;str4d&gt; The idea is that we focus development for three months on user- and developer-facing elements of I2P
&lt;str4d&gt; ie. things that people might actually care about, rather than streaming tweaks ;P
&lt;str4d&gt; And therefore things that are easier to do publicity on
&lt;str4d&gt; The rough idea is:
&lt;str4d&gt; - Summer of APIs: spend a month working on updating our libraries etc
&lt;str4d&gt; - Summer of Apps: spend a month working on helping other projects use those libraries
&lt;str4d&gt; - Summer of Plugins: spend a month working on our own apps and plugins
&lt;zzz&gt; right, this is about growing the network through outreach and making apps (ours and other people's) better
&lt;str4d&gt; Yep
&lt;zzz&gt; my idea was, if we can get 5 more Vuze's, we'll be 5 times bigger
&lt;EinMByte&gt; You might also want to add documentation to that
&lt;str4d&gt; Plus there's the whole Summer of Code ethos that we can hook into online
&lt;EinMByte&gt; no good API without decent documentation
&lt;zzz&gt; a lot of times we see some project thinking about i2p but they dont know much and dont get any help
&lt;str4d&gt; EinMByte, to the API parts, yes
&lt;zzz&gt; agreed 1mb
&lt;str4d&gt; ie. that would be on making our libraries and APIs as easy for devs to use as possible
&lt;z3r0fox&gt; Sounds like a good campaign idea! Worth a shot
&lt;str4d&gt; so e.g. updating txi2p, libsam etc. with SAMv3.3
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Supporting more languages?
&lt;EinMByte&gt; More interfacing through existing libraries
&lt;str4d&gt; Potentially, if we have the developers to help :)
&lt;str4d&gt; EinMByte, yah
&lt;zzz&gt; I'd like to sadie involved in this too with branding and outreach
&lt;EinMByte&gt; I think str4d's work with twisted is great, would be nice to do more stuff like that
&lt;str4d&gt; Fix the libtorrent support, try and get something into libp2p, etc.
&lt;zzz&gt; summer of i2p, or i2p summer of fun, etc
&lt;EinMByte&gt; i;e. do not write our own API from scratch but offer plugins for whatever framework people are using
&lt;str4d&gt; EinMByte, exactly.
&lt;zzz&gt; pushing sam 3.3, bringing all the various bridge libs up to date, documented, etc
&lt;str4d&gt; Or if we do offer our own API, make it as simple as possible. That's what I like about libsam, it is two files that any project can bundle (or ideally, any existing library)
&lt;zzz&gt; there's python and go and c and c++ and twisted and libtorrent and libsockets and and and...
&lt;zzz&gt; we fix up other people's stuff and do pull requests to them
&lt;EinMByte&gt; str4d: Agreed, APIs should be easy to bundle. It's a common problem for me
&lt;str4d&gt; While that is ongoing, we can ask other projects if they want help getting I2P into their apps
&lt;zzz&gt; why the heck doesn't libtorrent work? who can figure that out and get it fixed?
&lt;zzz&gt; ^^ as an example
&lt;str4d&gt; Then in the next phase of SoX, we then work on educating them and helping them use the newly-updated libraries and APIs
&lt;EinMByte&gt; sounds good
&lt;str4d&gt; It would be great to have buy-in with this from i2pd and kovri too, at least for the API part
&lt;str4d&gt; since we want to end up with apps being able to use whatever I2P backend they want
&lt;zzz&gt; i think we could get a lot of people excited here. I know psi is working on various libs
&lt;zzz&gt; we need a list of all the messaging apps we want to target
&lt;str4d&gt; And this is good for tying in with our existing outreach
&lt;EinMByte&gt; If we get the right PR it might be a success
&lt;EinMByte&gt; I want to create a simple C++ API for kovri, at some point
&lt;zzz&gt; great 1mb
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Then that API could be used from various programming languages. But this is a core API, not a client API (so use-case is somewhat different)
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Pretty much it should allow any application to bundle the kovri core.
&lt;zzz&gt; this would be a nice wholistic project to get everybody involved
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Agreed
&lt;str4d&gt; In my outreach todo list I have Tahoe-LAFS, IPFS, Tox, OpenBazaar, Zeronet...
&lt;zzz&gt; ok how do we move forward with this
&lt;zzz&gt; maybe sadie can give it  a cool name
&lt;str4d&gt; We essentially have until the end of May to plan this
&lt;str4d&gt; (while .25 and .26 are released)
&lt;zzz&gt; so after .26
&lt;zzz&gt; lets put this on the april 4 meeting agenda
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Ok.
&lt;EinMByte&gt; PR would have to attend, though
&lt;zzz&gt; june: APIs july: apps aug: plugins
&lt;EinMByte&gt; (so I think that's sadie, now?)
&lt;zzz&gt; also could wrap this around HOPE
&lt;z3r0fox&gt; I don't know many of the details obviously yet, but I'm not a terrible tech writer if anyone wants to assign me some grunt work
&lt;zzz&gt; ok let's ask sadie to flesh this out a little on april 4
&lt;sadie&gt; zzz - I can take care of graphics/ content with str4d for outreach
&lt;zzz&gt; ok
&lt;zzz&gt; anything else on summer of x?
&lt;sadie&gt; also, I will at Hope with stickers ..
&lt;str4d&gt; Nothing from me :)
&lt;amnesia&gt; Call it something other than Summer of X so it doesn't sound either non-descript, or like porn?
&lt;str4d&gt; amnesia, X is a placeholder
&lt;str4d&gt; (until we think of something better)
&lt;zzz&gt; ok. as I said at the top of the meeting, I'd like to defer discussion of 27-29 and the bigger roadmap and goals for 2nd half '16
&lt;amnesia&gt; Summer of Targetted Development?
&lt;zzz&gt; do we like these roadmap-specific meetings or not? should we do this again?
&lt;str4d&gt; amnesia, a little long IMHO
&lt;str4d&gt; We will think of something for the April meeting
&lt;zzz&gt; send your ideas for 'X' to sadie or post somewhere
&lt;str4d&gt; zzz, I like them
&lt;str4d&gt; And speaking of
&lt;zzz&gt; do we want another roadmap mtg in march?
&lt;sadie&gt; zzz , can we put something on forum where people can leave suggestions for the "summer of" name?
&lt;zzz&gt; yes sadie
&lt;str4d&gt; The other thing I wanted to bring up was the longer-term roadmapping
&lt;EinMByte&gt; zzz: Yes. We need more long-term
&lt;zzz&gt; we got our .25 release next weekend so that will keep us occupied
&lt;zzz&gt; maybe about 2 weeks from now for another roadmap meeting
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Unless we plan that for later, but at some point it will need discussion
&lt;str4d&gt; Sounds good
&lt;z3r0fox&gt; zzz: I think they're good. Keeps focus
&lt;str4d&gt; I want to suggest something for people to mull over
&lt;EinMByte&gt; zzz: sure
&lt;zzz&gt; want to go back to a tuesday 8 PM or do it on the weekend?
&lt;str4d&gt; In parallel with the SoX, I would like to have another two parallel streams of development work
&lt;str4d&gt; - Crypto migration
&lt;str4d&gt; - UI overhaul
&lt;str4d&gt; The blocker on both of these is research and design, not implementatino
&lt;EinMByte&gt; Does crypto migration include NTCP2?
&lt;str4d&gt; Yes
&lt;str4d&gt; So while we are doing SoX implementation stuff, we are also doing reviews of the various proposals etc.
&lt;zzz&gt; how is saturday March 19th
&lt;z3r0fox&gt; +1 Weekends
&lt;zzz&gt; 8 PM UTC Saturday March 19
&lt;str4d&gt; With a goal of having a plan ready to implement either during or after SoX
&lt;EinMByte&gt; March 19 seems good
&lt;str4d&gt; Likewise with UI, we need to start planning design work on that ASAP, because it will take a long time
&lt;sadie&gt; march 19th works for me
&lt;zzz&gt; ok sox == summer of x, got it
&lt;str4d&gt; Yes (until we change it :P )
&lt;str4d&gt; Design stuff can happen in parallel with everything else, and then implementation could happen after SoX
&lt;str4d&gt; It would be *so* nice if we could have a new UI in place for CCC
&lt;zzz&gt; ok I will get an agenda up on zzz.i2p, plus the notes, plus the logs from todays meeting on the website
&lt;str4d&gt; Anyway, stuff to think about
&lt;zzz&gt; anything else for today's meeting?
* zzz grabs the baffer
&lt;str4d&gt; We can discuss more at next roadmap
&lt;sadie&gt; baff it
&lt;str4d&gt; March 19 works for me :)
* zzz *baffs* it
&lt;zzz&gt; thanks everybody
