00:08 <@mids> {Due}: we will help you later
00:08 < {Due}> oka
00:09 <@nop> ok
00:09 <@nop> 3) Security Advisory
00:09 <@nop> accidentally came upon some weaknesses in Adelphia's PowerLink Network that is crucial to privacy
00:09 <@nop> so I felt the need to send them an advisory
00:09 <@nop> and post it to iip-dev list
00:09 < Debrys> Due: http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/aboutMain.php take a look at this page....... and also the interview and docs....... most of the things you're asking yourself get answered there :) they're really no nonsense page..... pure info and straight to the point
00:10 <@nop> anyway
00:10 <@nop> if any users use adelphia
00:10  * {Due} reading ;)
00:10 <@nop> that is the reason I posted it
00:10 <@nop> for the benefit of our users
00:10 <@nop> as they host 5.5 million customers
00:10 <@nop> so we might have a few
00:11 <@nop> hopefully they will adhere to the advisory and fix it
00:11 <@nop> if not
00:11 <@nop> it will be publicized 30 days from the date
00:11 <@nop> which will apply a bit of pressure to fix the problem
00:11 <@nop> moving on
00:11 <@nop> Connection issue
00:11 <@nop> with the upgrade
00:11 <@nop> a lot of people probably have been shutting off their previous rc2 relay
00:11 <@nop> and turning on rc3
00:12 <@nop> this probably will happen over a span of a couple weeks
00:12 <@nop> most people aren't consistant with keeping track of upgrade day
00:12 <@nop> also
00:12 <@nop> there were a few times this past week that the colocation facility of the ircd server had some network maintenance
00:12 <@nop> this caused a few hiccups
00:12 <@nop> and it may have beend difficult to get on
00:12 <@nop> this is over
00:12 <@nop> and it should be pretty clean (other than relays dropping from time to time)
00:13 < jeremiah_> will a relay notify the admin when it should be updated?
00:13 <@nop> as in the IIP software notify?
00:13 <@mids> currently, no
00:13 <@nop> the relay admin?
00:13 <@nop> that should be optional
00:13 <@nop> for debatable anonymity reasons
00:13 < jeremiah_> yeah, but it isn't an option right now, correct?
00:13 <@codeshark> nop: maybe a simple version check would help
00:13 <@nop> correct it is not
00:14 <@nop> definitely an option that could appear in 1.1
00:14 <@nop> stable
00:14 <@nop> but I can't promise that
00:14 <@nop> as we want to keep changes to a minimum
00:14 < jeremiah_> ok
00:14 <@mids> I suggest we dont put it in
00:14 <@mids> only fix bugs
00:14 <@nop> as well do I for this version
00:14 <@codeshark> yes, no new features
00:15 <@hezekiah> I agree.
00:15 <@nop> ok
00:15 <@mids> are there any bug reports yet?
00:15 <@nop> I know that codeshark had one
00:15 <@codeshark> yeah, couldn't send mail, damn invisiblenet ;)
00:16 <@nop> haha
00:16 <@nop> send it when you can
00:16 <@nop> there's a couple of firewall questions
00:16 <@codeshark> iip.log, isproxy.ini, mynode.ref, seed.rnd are stored in current directory instead of ~iip/.iip  dir
00:16 <@nop> I think we might have to be more clear that 6667 isn't the only connection that should be open
00:17 <@nop> can you officially send it as an email
00:17 <@nop> it helps for tracking
00:17 <@codeshark> doesn't work ;)
00:17 <@nop> mail shoudl work
00:17 <@mids> nop: do you mean firewall rules for outgoing connections?
00:18 <@nop> yes
00:18 <@mids> ok
00:18 <@nop> I don't think all users realize how it works
00:18 <@mids> yeah we can add that to the firewall chapter of the FAQ
00:18 <@nop> ok
00:18 <@mids> or create that one if it doesnt exist
00:18 <@nop> anyway, cs can you submit it to our sourceforge bug report page
00:18 < {Due}> ok, one second
00:19 < {Due}> may i ask something?
00:19 <@nop> hold
00:19 <@nop> what's next on agenda
00:19 <@mids> question round!
00:19 <@nop> ok
00:19 <@nop> due
00:19 < {Due}> ;)
00:19 <@nop> you can ask
00:19 < {Due}> oka
00:19 <@codeshark> nop: ok
00:20 < {Due}> 1) mids says tha this servers is anonymoues
00:20 < {Due}> anonymous
00:20 < {Due}> <mids> we dont know where the server is
00:20 < {Due}> newsserver1.ussc.com
00:20 <@nop> that's a relay
00:20 <@nop> 1 of many
00:20 <@nop> your peers protect you
00:20  * Neo stands in question queue
00:21 < {Due}> but what is the meaning of all that?
00:21 < {Due}> i mean, all the ircu servers
00:21 <@mids> I'll try to help {Due} in private
00:21 < {Due}> has vhost
00:21 < {Due}> oka mind
00:21 <@nop> neo yes
00:21 <@mids> pop queue, neo
00:21 < Neo> Ok.
00:22 < Neo> nop: can you please give us:
00:22 < Neo> diff 'invisible internet' 'tarzan'
00:22 < Neo> thoughts please.
00:22 <@nop> I need to finish my read on tarzan before I can answer that
00:22 <@nop> but they are similar
00:22 <@nop> but I find some problems with tarzan
00:22  * jeremiah_  would like a url that describes tarzan
00:23 <@nop> neo do you have the url handy
00:23 < Neo> http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/tarzan/index.html
00:23 < jeremiah_> thank you
00:23 <@nop> I'll tell you what neo
00:23 <@nop> when I finish my read
00:23 <@nop> I will send you an email
00:23 <@nop> on my thoughts
00:24 <@hezekiah> What if you just submit the email to iip-dev?
00:24 <@nop> ok
00:24 < Rav-> can i make a suggestion
00:24 < Rav-> for the node.ref etc files
00:24 <@nop> there are aspects that can be fully utilized from tarzan
00:24 < Neo> nop: thanks
00:24 < Rav-> store them in user home directories
00:24 <@hezekiah> That would be nice.
00:24 < Rav-> so its easier to secure a proxy
00:24 < Rav-> and have it update noninteractively
00:25 < Debrys> ahem:....... it would be nice if i could use IIP withouth installation and copied file....... i.e. copy the files on a disk......... go to someone with a pc and irc-client........ run IIP from disk withouth any files copied to the hard-disk....... so i would be thankfull if this user-home-dirs thingie would be an option
00:27 <@mids> currently it _should_ look in several places
00:27 <@mids> current directory, homedir
00:27 <@mids> and system wide directory
00:27 <@mids> I dont remember in what order that happens
00:27 < jeremiah_> it would also good to be able to run the system from memory w/o config files so someoen could use it and then delete it easily (not sure how possible this is right now)
00:27 < Debrys> okay, thanks for the info mids
00:28 <@nop> knoppix
00:28 <@nop> www.knoppix.net
00:28 <@mids> Debrys: but codeshark just reported a bug on that, so it might not work :)
00:28 <@codeshark> Debrys: yes, there's a problem with this feature
00:28 <@codeshark> some files are stored in local directory
00:28 < xcasex> jeremiah_: just mount a portion of ram to the filesystem D:
00:28 < xcasex> :D
00:28 < Debrys> well, i'm okay if i know it will work in the future :)
00:29 < Debrys> its just a possibility i would miss if it would be discarded in future development
00:29 < Rav-> from memory only the node.ref file needs to be local.. is that right?
00:30 <@nop> 7and listen.ref
00:30 <@nop> and
00:30 < Debrys> cs: local dir is okay....... because the local dir would be the diskette?
00:30 <@nop> and isproxy.ini
00:30 < Rav-> yeah thats right
00:30 < Rav-> 3 files
00:30 <@nop> although
00:30 < Debrys> the only problem would be if its run from a cd........ but thats okay to me
00:30 <@mids> you can specify the file location if you run isproxy
00:30 <@mids> try: isproxy -h
00:30 <@mids> if will give an overview of options
00:31 < Debrys> °nods°
00:31 < Rav-> atm i have those 3 files rw for users since iip starts as a user daemon not a system daemon
00:32 <@nop> ok
00:32 <@nop> I'll bb in a bit
00:33 <@mids> other questions?
00:33 < Debrys> not for now or 1.1
00:33 < Rav-> mmm... update notification?
00:33 < Rav-> wouldnt be anonymous i guess
00:34 <@mids> Rav-: the server could send a control message
00:34 < Rav-> okay
00:34 <@mids> atually it already sends the version I think
00:34 <@mids> but then again
00:34 <@mids> if I run a public relay
00:35 <@mids> what should the relay do if it sees that it is too old?
00:35 < Rav-> you could include it in node.ref
00:35 < Rav-> dunno
00:35 < jeremiah_> it could be given the option of emailing the admin
00:35 < jeremiah_> or anonymail
00:35 <@mids> yeah maybe
00:35 < Debrys> what if clients get to know about a new version from other clients..... not the server? this could also work in a decentralized network........ since if update notification is server dependant it wouldn't work when IIP goes decentralized?
00:36 < Rav-> yeah thats why i was thinking node.ref
00:36 <@mids> I dont think it is possible to do it in a decentralized environment
00:36 <@mids> unless you sign those messages by the IIP development team
00:36 <@mids> since otherwise it would be too easy to send fake messages
00:36 < hezekiah> Right
00:37 < Debrys> thats true
00:37 < Rav-> hmm
00:37 <@mids> actually
00:37 <@mids> once it is fully distributed
00:37 <@mids> it could well be that there are multiple version
00:37 < Debrys> but would it be THAT evil if a fake "new version" message is received? except of being annoying?
00:37 <@mids> +s
00:37 <@mids> and clones etc
00:38 <@mids> Debrys: it would be easy to do, and make it not useful anymore
00:38 < Rav-> that should be a good case for update notification
00:38 < Debrys> okay
00:38 <@mids> what would be better is the admins subscribing to the IIP development mailinglist
00:38 < Rav-> dont know how you would dist the message
00:38 <@mids> :)
00:38 <@mids> maybe we should make other mailinglists in the future
00:38 <@mids> like iip-announce
00:39 < xcasex> dont forget the-iip-133+3
00:39  * jeremiah_  has to go
00:39 < jeremiah_> bye
00:39 < jeremiah_> will login later
00:39 < Rav-> when you say distributed, do you mean as part of a decentralised iip network or do you mean you are releasing the server daemon for use on other networks
00:39 < hezekiah> bye
00:42 <@mids> Rav-: decentralized
00:44 < hezekiah> Well, I'm off. Bye everyone.
00:45 <@mids> ok
00:45 <@mids> hereby I declare the meeting beeing over
00:45 <@mids> see you next week, same time, same place
00:46 <@mids> feel free to hang around a bit
00:46 <@mids> and if there are more questions / comments, ask em in #iip or #anonymous
