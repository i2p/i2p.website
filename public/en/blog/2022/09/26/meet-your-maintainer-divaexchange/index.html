        </div>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>In this second installment of Meet Your Maintainer, I reached out to
Konrad from DIVA.EXCHANGE to talk about DIVA&rsquo;s research and services.
DIVA.EXCHANGE is developing software with the goal of providing free
banking technology for everyone. It is secure without a central
infrastructure, and based on blockchain and I2P technology.</em></p>
<p><strong>What got you interested in I2P?</strong></p>
<p>About 10 years ago I had a presentation for &ldquo;Technologieforum Zug&rdquo; - a
very local technology network for business guys. I was introducing I2P
and Tor as overlay networks to them - to show them that other
interesting things exist out there.</p>
<p>I was always very much interested in cryptography related technology. In
general I can say that my core interests were and still are: networks,
freedom and privacy on both a technical and social level, interesting
algos, like HashCash between 2000 and 2010, which was a very well
working Proof-of-Work algo created at Universities in the UK in the late
90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I2P fascinated me because it is really carefully done - from the
architecture to the implementation in Java and C++. Personally I prefer
de-coupled and small programs doing one thing. Hence I was pretty
fascinated by the C++ version, I2Pd, which is lean, fast and without
dependencies. It works very well for me.</p>
<p><strong>What are the qualities in its technical capacity that aligned with
your own work or interests?</strong></p>
<p>I adore craftsmanship. That&rsquo;s art. And I2P is modern craftsmanship. I2P
creates values for end users values which can&rsquo;t be bought: autonomy,
liberty and serenity.</p>
<p>I2P fascinates me because it&rsquo;s agnostic. Anyone can run anything on I2P
as long as it talks TCP or UDP - and can handle some latency. Really:
&ldquo;the network is the computer&rdquo; and the communication is truly private
according to the current state of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Who is DIVA for?</strong></p>
<p>DIVA gets actively developed and therefore the project is for
researchers, software developers, communicators (writers, illustrators…)
and for people who want to learn really new stuff in the area of
distributed technology.</p>
<p>Once DIVA grows up - please don&rsquo;t ask me when - DIVA will be a fully
distributed, self-hosted bank for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell me about what DIVA does?</strong></p>
<p>As said, DIVA will be a fully distributed, self-hosted bank for
everyone. &ldquo;Banking&rdquo; means: savings, payments, investments, loans - so
all that stuff everybody is doing everyday. Please note in this context:
DIVA works without any central infrastructure and DIVA will never - as
long as I have something to say - be a coin or token. There can&rsquo;t be any
central business model involved. If a transaction creates fees because a
node of the distributed infrastructure did some work, then these fees
remain at the node which did the work.</p>
<p>Why a &ldquo;bank&rdquo;? Because financial liberty and autonomy is key to live a
good and peaceful life and to be able to make all those smaller and
larger daily decisions in freedom. Therefore people shall own their
small and secure technology components to do whatever they like to do
without being nudged.</p>
<p>Well, say hello to DIVA, based on I2P.</p>
<p><strong>What are your upcoming goals? What are your stretch goals?</strong></p>
<p>There is a very close goal: understanding the impact of SSU2 which has
been lately implemented in I2P. This is a technical goal for the next
few weeks.</p>
<p>Then, probably this year: some cryptocurrency transactions using DIVA on
testnets. Please don&rsquo;t forget: DIVA is a research project and people
shall be motivated to do their own stuff with DIVA - the way they need
it. We don&rsquo;t run any infrastructure or alike for others except some
transparent test networks to increase the knowledge and wisdom of
everyone. It&rsquo;s recommended to stay in touch with DIVA via social
networks (<a href="http://twitter.com/@DigitalValueX">@DigitalValueX</a>) or
chats to be inspired what to do with DIVA.</p>
<p>I also want to touch an important part for the I2P community: DIVA is
based on divachain - which is then based on I2P. Divachain is a very
generic fully distributed storage layer. So, just as an example: if some
I2P developer believes that a fully distributed, trustless DNS would be
a great idea - well, that&rsquo;s yet another use case of divachain. Fully
distributed - no trust needed - all anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the other services and contributions you are
responsible for?</strong></p>
<p>DIVA.EXCHANGE - which is the open association developing DIVA - runs a
reseed server for I2P since a few years. So probably almost every I2P
user got somehow in touch with us in the past. Just a note: the
DIVA.EXCHANGE reseed server is also available as .onion service - so I2P
bootstrapping can be done via the tor network - which is, at least from
my perspective, an additional protection layer while entering the
network.</p>
<p>DIVA has also created an I2P SAM library. So developers can create any
modern application based on I2P. It&rsquo;s on github and getting more and
more popular: <a href="http://github.com/diva-exchange/i2p-sam/">github.com/diva-exchange/i2p-sam/</a>.
It&rsquo;s complete, well documented and offers lots of examples.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the priorities you think that anyone who wants to
contribute to the I2P network should consider?</strong></p>
<p>Run your I2P node. Take a look at the different flavours, like Docker
versions of I2Pd, or other installs available for multiple operating
systems. There are several flavours available and it&rsquo;s important to be
comfortable with the local installation and configuration.</p>
<p>Then: think about your skills - networking skills, programming skills,
communication skills? I2P offers lots of interesting challenges: people
with networking skills might want to run a reseed server - they are very
important to the network. Programmers might help with the Go, C++ or
Java version of I2P. And communicators are always needed: talking about
I2P from an objective and realistic perspective is helping a lot. Every
little bit is great.</p>
<p>Last but not least: if you are a researcher or student - please get in
touch with us at DIVA.EXCHANGE or the I2P team - research work is
important for I2P.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see the conversation and outlook on tools like I2P now?</strong></p>
<p>Probably I have to say something about the outlook: I2P is important to
everyone. I hope that the I2P community - developers, communicators,
etc. - remains motivated by the few which deeply appreciate their hard
work on truly challenging technology.</p>
<p>I hope that more and more developers see the benefit to develop software
based on I2P. Because this would create more use cases for end users.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell me a bit about your own I2P workflow? What are your own
use cases?</strong></p>
<p>I am a developer, tester and researcher. So I need all my stuff in
containers to remain flexible. I2Pd is running in 1..n containers on
multiple systems to serve stuff like: feeding reseed requests, serving
the diva.i2p test website, running parts of the DIVA I2P test network -
see testnet.diva.exchange and I also have containers to serve my local
browsers as a combined I2P and Tor proxy.</p>
<p><strong>How can the I2P community support your work?</strong></p>
<p>We are on social media, like <a href="http://twitter.com/@DigitalValueX">@DigitalValueX</a> - so
follow us there. Additionally we would love to see even more involvement
on <a href="http://github.com/diva-exchange">github.com/diva-exchange</a> - it
already got more and more attention in the past months. Thanks a lot for
that!</p>
