<div class="irc-log">
(08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: Hello everyone, welcome to the rescheduled dev meeting
(08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 1. Hi 
(08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.0.0 Release Status, 2.0.0 Mac Release Status 
(08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 2.1.0 Development Status 
(08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Stickers for Translators
(08:00:50 PM) zzz: hi
(08:02:55 PM) eyedeekay: Doesn't seem like he's here? going to move along for now.
(08:04:04 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.0.0 release status: *most* targets of 2.0.0 were released about 3 weeks ago now, including i2p.i2p, Android, Debian and Easy-Install Windows, with Easy-Install for Mac delayed by zlatinb's departure
(08:04:04 PM) eyedeekay: Ech and I have been working on a plan to replace him in terms of maintenance, signing, and notarization of the OSX bundle, that is still expected for close to the end of this month
(08:06:01 PM) eyedeekay: Everybody knows how to build everything, has a good idea of the signing requirements, the last remaining thing to do is notarization in practice, and we don't know everything we should expect here but I think we have a good idea
(08:07:10 PM) eyedeekay: Android needed a point release due to a bug related to compatibility with a new API on newer devices, so Android users should make sure they've upgraded to 2.0.1
(08:07:10 PM) eyedeekay: eot for me on 2, anything to add zzz
(08:07:20 PM) zzz: lots
(08:07:50 PM) uis is now known as Irc2PGuest69907
(08:08:04 PM) zzz: I had to release a 2.0.0-2ubunutu1 debian/ubuntu build to fix an embarrassing but ultimately harmless bunch of stray symlinks in root
(08:08:38 PM) zzz: root cause was a typo, deb lint didn't catch it, not sure what the post mortem lesson is other than be more careful, we're root on install...
(08:09:12 PM) zzz: as far as the network, after 3 weeks, half of it has updated and is using ssu2
(08:09:39 PM) zzz: exploratory build success has been trending straight down since the release
(08:09:56 PM) zzz: we're concerned, and monitoring closely
(08:10:47 PM) zzz: at this point we think it's some combination of ssu-to-ssu2 migration, ssu2 bugs on both our side and in i2pd, and a couple of routers that are spamming the network with tunnel builds
(08:11:05 PM) zzz: i2pd is considering a mid-cycle january point release to get their fixes out
(08:11:33 PM) zzz: for now I don't think that's necessary on our side but it's always an option should we choose to
(08:12:18 PM) zzz: I think that's EOT but I'll have more info in a moment as a part of 3)
(08:13:09 PM) eyedeekay: Thank you zzz
(08:13:43 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 2.1.0 Development Status
(08:17:12 PM) eyedeekay: We're 3 weeks in to this cycle, in this time I've been working on getting Android migrated fully over to the modern gradle plugin, I stopped short of migrating from maven to maven-push before release, after that, what's on the list for Android is orbot-style split tunneling for configuring apps without a proxy(Sort of the Android version of torsocks)
(08:17:12 PM) eyedeekay: For desktop I've been working on getting our integration into Whonix fixed and have been work related to getting the Easy-Install for Windows out of beta
(08:18:43 PM) eyedeekay: That's what I'm working on, zzz would you like to continue with your information or 3)?
(08:19:43 PM) dr|z3d: ... intermission ...
(08:23:56 PM) anonymousmaybe is now known as Irc2PGuest40130
(08:24:03 PM) eyedeekay: Welcome back
(08:25:17 PM) eyedeekay: What was the last thing you got?
(08:26:28 PM) zzz: back
(08:26:28 PM) zzz: is it my turn yet? :)
(08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: you need to put on an apron and wheel the confectionery tray around the theater :)
(08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: did you go out to get us all ice cream? :)
(08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: recap:
(08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: &lt;eyedeekay&gt; We're 3 weeks in to this cycle, in this time I've been working on getting Android migrated fully over to the modern gradle plugin, I stopped short of migrating from maven to maven-push before release, after that, what's on the list for Android is orbot-style split tunneling for configuring apps without a proxy(Sort of the Android version of torsocks)
(08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: &lt;eyedeekay&gt; For desktop I've been working on getting our integration into Whonix fixed and have been work related to getting the Easy-Install for Windows out of beta
(08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: &lt;eyedeekay&gt; That's what I'm working on, zzz would you like to continue with your information or 3)?
(08:26:48 PM) zzz: thanks
(08:27:04 PM) zzz: drz gave it to me
(08:27:12 PM) zzz: ok, my turn!
(08:27:33 PM) zzz: about a week and a half after the release, when a lot of the net had updated, I started chasing SSU2 problems
(08:27:42 PM) zzz: and found a whole lot
(08:27:56 PM) zzz: both ours and helped i2pd find some of theirs
(08:27:58 PM) zzz: so it's been quite busy
(08:28:14 PM) zzz: as a result, we're at almost 7000 lines of diff, more than the whole 2.0.0 release
(08:28:38 PM) zzz: and whatever else I had planned for 2.1.0 I haven't gotten to yet, including promised peer selection improvements
(08:29:50 PM) zzz: I plan to bump to -7 after the meeting
(08:29:50 PM) zzz: while the "big changes in" deadline is early January, let's stay flexible, as we don't want a bunch of WIP in there if we're going to do a 2.0.1 release
(08:29:59 PM) zzz: so let's try not to break things with "big changes" if possible. Big changes are fine, as long as they're isolated
(08:30:40 PM) zzz: but things are going well and we're working closely with i2pd to track down and fix issues
(08:31:02 PM) zzz: including one-in-a-million ones that are now popping up
(08:31:16 PM) zzz: and one-in-a-zillion ones that dr|z3d is finding on his high speed routers
(08:31:30 PM) zzz: that's it! EOT, any questions?
(08:32:27 PM) eyedeekay: I'm slightly curious how often a "Million" of some things happens in in the real world but possibly a question for another time
(08:33:17 PM) eyedeekay: Thanks zzz
(08:34:12 PM) eyedeekay: It seems like once you get a whole bunch of routers doing a thing the odds of a rare event happening somewhere would go up very fast
(08:35:11 PM) zzz: yeah. perhaps we should have been more cautious, and not go from 2% to 100% in one release. But we'll get through it
(08:35:17 PM) uis is now known as Irc2PGuest38853
(08:37:15 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Stickers for Translators
(08:37:15 PM) eyedeekay: Only real news here is that I now have stickers for mailing, I've got a ton of them so if you're in the Americas then I am prepared to mail them
(08:37:58 PM) zzz: would you please post something on my forum, saying who is eligible and how to request
(08:38:17 PM) eyedeekay: Can do
(08:38:29 PM) zzz: then I will copy paste over to transifex announcement
(08:38:48 PM) zzz: what's the status of the euro side?
(08:39:44 PM) eyedeekay: Don't know if he has his yet, will request an update from him tonight
(08:40:07 PM) zzz: ok, guess I need to wait for that part of it before transifex
(08:40:43 PM) zzz: please whack him with your baffer for making us reschedule and then not showing :)
(08:41:07 PM) eyedeekay: Well it was my fault too but I'll make sure to let him know :)
(08:41:32 PM) zzz: I mean yesterday to today. you're not off the hook for last week :)
(08:42:41 PM) eyedeekay: That's all I've got for 4 and/or today, anything else for the meeting?
(08:42:50 PM) zzz: nope
(08:43:02 PM) zzz: are we on or off for Jan. 3?
(08:44:26 PM) eyedeekay: All right then thanks zzz for coming, I was going to say "On" for Jan 3 but we could do the 10th instead since IIRC LS2 will be the 9th
(08:45:01 PM) zzz: doesn't matter, your call
(08:45:35 PM) eyedeekay: Let's have it on the 9th in January and return to first-Tuesday in February
(08:45:52 PM) zzz: you mean 10th?
(08:45:59 PM) eyedeekay: Yes the 10th
(08:46:07 PM) zzz: ok
(08:46:15 PM) zzz: meeting over?
(08:46:25 PM) eyedeekay: Yes
